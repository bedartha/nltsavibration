abstract = {Physiological systems are best characterized as complex dynamical processes that are continuously subjected to and updated by nonlinear feedforward and feedback inputs. System outputs usually exhibit wide varieties of behaviors due to dynamical interactions between system components, external noise perturbations, and physiological state changes. Complicated interactions occur at a variety of hierarchial levels and involve a number of interacting variables, many of which are unavailable for experimental measurement. In this paper we illustrate how recurrence plots can take single physiological measurements, project them into multidimensional space by embedding procedures, and identify time correlations (recurrences) that are not apparent in the one-dimensional time series. We extend the original description of recurrence plots by computing an array of specific recurrence variables that quantify the deterministic structure and complexity of the plot. We then demonstrate how physiological states can be assessed by making repeated recurrence plot calculations within a window sliding down any physiological dynamic. Unlike other predominant time series techniques, recurrence plot analyses are not limited by data stationarity and size constraints. Pertinent physiological examples from respiratory and skeletal motor systems illustrate the utility of recurrence plots in the diagnosis of nonlinear systems. The methodology is fully applicable to any rhythmical system, whether it be mechanical, electrical, neural, hormonal, chemical, or even spacial.},

Autonomic control in diabetic subjects was assessed by the Ewing test. HR variability was explored by both linear and nonlinear methods. Linear methods used HR standard deviation and power spectrum. The percentage of the spectrum in the low frequencies was used to assess the sympathetic tone of the autonomic control. The nonlinear method used the "recurrence plot." This method explored long parallel subsequences in the HR time series. These sequences characterize the dependence of the HR dynamics on initial values. The HR standard deviation was reduced in the diabetic subjects compared with the healthy subjects (2.80 +/- 1.17 vs. 3.64 +/- 1.45 beats/min; P {\textless} 0.001). In the diabetic subjects, the HR standard deviation and the percentage of the spectrum in the low frequencies showed no correlations with the Ewing score (P {\textgreater} 0.10). In contrast, the longest length index was very strongly correlated to the Ewing score (r = -0.60; P {\textless} 0.0001). The results suggest that nonlinear methods might be powerful to explore the autonomic dysfunction in diabetic subjects.},

abstract = {The classical description of ventriculoarterial coupling by calculating the ratio between the effective arterial elastance Ea to the end-systolic elastance Ees does not give insight into the underlying dynamics of the interaction between left-ventricular pressure (LVP) and aortic pressure (AOP) and flow (AOF). The aim of this study was to introduce a state space representation for the ventriculoarterial coupling and to quantify changes of the coupling state. METHODS: A ventriculoarterial state space orbit VAO was defined to be dependent on three variables: VAO = [LVP(t), AOP(t + delta t), AOF(t + delta t)]. Changes in the coupling effect directly or indirectly on the time series of these parameters. They reflect the actual state of the cardiovascular system. The time delay delta t between the LVP and the aortic signals takes respect to the short delay between the heart action and the resulting waves in the arterial tree. The recurrence map of the VAO(i) (i = 1 .. N, N = number of points) is constructed by plotting the index i of every single point on the orbit (x-axis) against the indices of his 10 nearest neighbors (y-axis) in distance. The data were recorded in 9 anaesthetized pigs with a sample frequency of 512 Hz over a period of 6 seconds using piezoelectric pressure sensors and a Doppler flowmeter. A control condition was compared to a total occlusion of the descending aorta as a strong artificial disturbance of ventriculoarterial interaction. The nonlinear parameters percent recurrence, percent determinism and the entropy were calculated from the plot. RESULTS: Periodic crossing points and forbidden zones in all plots identify the nonlinear character of the chosen variables. The recurrent patterns are less rigid for control conditions than for total occlusion. Entropy (2.3{\%} rise) and determinism (24{\%} rise) are significantly (p {\textless} 0.003) increased. Total aortic occlusion leads to more complex time correlation patterns. CONCLUSIONS: These results may reflect the loss of an ideal coupling state leading to a more complex deterministic behavior of the overall regulatory system. Because recurrence plots do not impose rigid constraints on data set size, stationarity, or statistical distribution, we hypothesize that this technique might be useful to describe the nonlinear dynamics between left ventricle and arterial system.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the presence of organization of atrial activation processes during atrial fibrillation (AF) by assessing whether the activation sequences are wholly random or are governed by deterministic mechanisms. We performed both linear and nonlinear analyses based on the cross correlation function (CCF) and recurrence plot quantification (RPQ), respectively. Recurrence plots were quantified by three variables: percent recurrence (PR), percent determinism (PD), and entropy of recurrences (ER). We recorded bipolar intra-atrial electrograms in two atrial sites during chronic AF in 19 informed subjects, following two protocols. In one, both recording sites were in the right atrium; in the other protocol, one site was in the right atrium, the other one in the left atrium. We extracted 19 episodes of type I AF (Wells' classification). RPQ detected transient recurrent patterns in all the episodes, while CCF was significant only in ten episodes. Surrogate data analysis, based on a cross-phase randomization procedure, decreased PR, PD, and ER values. The detection of spatiotemporal recurrent patterns together with the surrogate data results indicate that during AF a certain degree of local organization exists, likely caused by deterministic mechanisms of activation.},

abstract = {The knowledge of transitions between regular, laminar or chaotic behavior is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms behind complex systems. While several linear approaches are often insufficient to describe such processes, there are several nonlinear methods which however require rather long time observations. To overcome these difficulties, we propose measures of complexity based on vertical structures in recurrence plots and apply them to the logistic map as well as to heart rate variability data. For the logistic map these measures enable us not only to detect transitions between chaotic and periodic states, but also to identify laminar states, i.e. chaos-chaos transitions. The traditional recurrence quantification analysis fails to detect the latter transitions. Applying our new measures to the heart rate variability data, we are able to detect and quantify the laminar phases before a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia occurs thereby facilitating a prediction of such an event. Our findings could be of importance for the therapy of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.},

The complex dynamics of the healthy heart-beat arise from numerous coupled control systems and feedback loops that regulate the cardiac cycle on different time scales.

abstract = {Recurrence plots provide a graphical representation of the recurrent patterns in a timeseries, the quantification of which is a relatively new field. Here we derive analytical expressions which relate the values of key statistics, notably determinism and entropy of line length distribution, to the correlation sum as a function of embedding dimension. These expressions are obtained by deriving the transformation which generates an embedded recurrence plot from an unembedded plot. A single unembedded recurrence plot thus provides the statistics of all possible embedded recurrence plots. If the correlation sum scales exponentially with embedding dimension, we show that these statistics are determined entirely by the exponent of the exponential. This explains the results of Iwanski and Bradley [J.S. Iwanski, E. Bradley, Recurrence plots of experimental data: to embed or not to embed? Chaos 8 (1998) 861-871] who found that certain recurrence plot statistics are apparently invariant to embedding dimension for certain low-dimensional systems. We also examine the relationship between the mutual information content of two timeseries and the common recurrent structure seen in their recurrence plots. This allows time-localized contributions to mutual information to be visualized. This technique is demonstrated using geomagnetic index data; we show that the AU and AL geomagnetic indices share half their information, and find the timescale on which mutual features appear. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In performing a quantitative assessment of dynamical transition patterns of IP-network traffic, we used the values of determinism (DET) defined by the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Also, in evaluating fractal-related properties of IP-network traffic, we employed the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), which is applicable to the analysis of long-range dependence (LRD) in nonstationary time-series signals. Furthermore, to obtain a comprehensive view of network traffic conditions, we used a self-organizing map, which provides a way to map high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional domain. When applying this method to traffic analysis, we performed two kinds of traffic measurement in Tokyo, Japan, and derived values of DET and the LRD-based scaling parameteralphaof IP-network traffic. Then, we found that the characteristic with respect to DET and self-similarity seen in the measured traffic fluctuated over time, with different time variation patterns for two measurements. In training the self-organizing map, we used three parameters: average throughput, variation ratio of DET, and {\&}alpha;-value. As a result, we visually confirmed that the traffic data could be projected onto the map in accordance with traffic properties, resulting in a combined depiction of the effects of the DET and network utilization rates on the time-variations of LRD.},

Knowledge of transitions from regular to chaotic behavior is essential to understand the underlying dynamics of nonlinear switching circuits. While linear approaches are often insufficient to describe such processes, there are nonlinear methods available but requires long time observations. To overcome these difficulties, a newly developed pattern recognition method of nonlinear dynamics called Recurrence plot analysis method is proposed to detect transitions between periodic and chaotic states. The recurrence plot is a two-dimensional representation technique that brings out distance correlations in a time series and make it instantly apparent whether a system is periodic or chaotic. In this paper, the proposed method is applied to a nonlinear switching Buck converter, Boost converter, and Buck-Boost converters to analyze their period doubling route to chaos behavior and to distinguish chaos from noisy behavior. This may lead to a better understanding of the nonlinear switching systems, that may allow us to design stable, chaotic free switching circuits.},

We have taken three prime quantification techniques namely Recurrence Rate, Entropy and Average Diagonal Length. The information about the system gets distributed in these quantities. Hence we need a model that is capable of taking into account the information from all the three RQA techniques. Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) can model these information very efficiently. For this purpose we have used Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) which is a special case of DBNs.

As the struggle for ball possession is a key element of play strategy/ tactics in elite football matches, analysis of the non-linear evolution and transitions of passing sequences of teams may yield information about their play organization.

abstract = {Objective: Understanding the transition of brain activity towards an absence seizure is a challenging task. In this paper, we use recurrence quantification analysis to indicate the deterministic dynamics of EEG series at the seizure-free, pre-seizure and seizure states in genetic absence epilepsy rats. Methods: The determinism measure, DET, based on recurrence plot, was applied to analyse these three EEG datasets, each dataset containing 300 single-channel EEG epochs of 5-s duration. Then, statistical analysis of the DET values in each dataset was carried out to determine whether their distributions over the three groups were significantly different. Furthermore, a surrogate technique was applied to calculate the significance level of determinism measures in EEG recordings. Results: The mean (±SD) DET of EEG was 0.177 ± 0.045 in pre-seizure intervals. The DET values of pre-seizure EEG data are significantly higher than those of seizure-free intervals, 0.123 ± 0.023, (P {\textless} 0.01), but lower than those of seizure intervals, 0.392 ± 0.110, (P {\textless} 0.01). Using surrogate data methods, the significance of determinism in EEG epochs was present in 25 of 300 (8.3{\%}), 181 of 300 (60.3{\%}) and 289 of 300 (96.3{\%}) in seizure-free, pre-seizure and seizure intervals, respectively. Conclusions: Results provide some first indications that EEG epochs during pre-seizure intervals exhibit a higher degree of determinism than seizure-free EEG epochs, but lower than those in seizure EEG epochs in absence epilepsy. Significance: The proposed methods have the potential of detecting the transition between normal brain activity and the absence seizure state, thus opening up the possibility of intervention, whether electrical or pharmacological, to prevent the oncoming seizure. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics theory has been a tool of choice in the analysis of physiological signals and systems. This paper presents a novel approach in the analysis of tracheal swallowing and breath sounds based on nonlinear dynamics theory. As the tracheal sound signal is nonstationary, the signal was studied based on the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) method, which is a useful technique in the analysis of nonstationary and noisy signals. Tracheal sound recordings of 15 healthy and 9 dysphagic subjects were studied. The multidimensional state space trajectory of each signal was reconstructed using Taken's method of delays. The reconstructed trajectories were analyzed by the RQA technique. The preliminary results suggested that some recurrence parameters were appreciably different between swallowing and breath sounds. In order to confirm discriminating ability of the parameters, an automated method for extraction of swallowing sounds in the records of the tracheal swallowing and breath sounds was investigated. The swallowing sound extraction results were validated by manual inspection of the simultaneously recorded airflow signal and spectrogram of the sounds and also by auditory means. Experimental results proved that the investigated method more accurately detected the boundaries of swallowing sounds than methods proposed previously. Swallowing sound detection may be employed in a system for automated swallowing assessment and diagnosis of swallowing disorders (dysphagia) by acoustical means. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Automated detection of swallowing sounds in swallowing and breath sound recordings is of importance for monitoring purposes in which the recording durations are long. This paper presents a novel method for swallowing sound detection using hidden Markov modeling of recurrence plot features. Tracheal sound recordings of 15 healthy and nine dysphagic subjects were studied. The multidimensional state space trajectory of each signal was reconstructed using the Taken method of delays. The sequences of three recurrence plot features of the reconstructed trajectories (which have shown discriminating capability between swallowing and breath sounds) were modeled by three hidden Markov models. The Viterbi algorithm was used for swallowing sound detection. The results were validated manually by inspection of the simultaneously recorded airflow signal and spectrogram of the sounds, and also by auditory means. The experimental results suggested that the performance of the proposed method using hidden Markov modeling of recurrence plot features was superior to the previous swallowing sound detection methods. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper describes a recurrence plot (RP) approach to the analysis of non-stationary transition patterns of IP-network traffic. To get a quantitative measure of dynamical transition patterns of IP-network traffic, we used the values of determinism (DET) defined by the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Also, when evaluating the fractal-based properties of IP-network traffic, we focused on two parameters: (i) the long-range dependence (LRD)-related scaling parameter $\alpha$ derived from the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and (ii) the range of the generalized fractal dimension. In applying this method to traffic analysis, we performed two kinds of traffic measurement in Tokyo, Japan, and derived the values of DET and fractal-based parameters of IP-network traffic over time. In checking the measured network traffic, we found that the characteristic with respect to DET and self-similarity seen in the measured network traffic fluctuated over time, with different time-variation patterns for two measurement locations. Results also confirmed that a larger value of DET or accumulated DET reflected increases in the degree of LRD of IP-network traffic and that the accumulated DET reflected the decreases in the degree of multi-fractality of IP-network traffic. As a result, we confirmed that RP-based measures can be effective for evaluating the non-stationary transition patterns of IP-network traffic in terms of quantitative fractal-based properties. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Irradiation effects on tracking resistance of polymer insulation materials should be investigated due to the increasing usage in radiation-prone environments. This paper presents a study on dc tracking resistance of gamma-ray irradiated polycarbonate mixed with polyethylene by use of IEC 60112 method. The samples were irradiated in air up to 100 kGy and 1000 kGy with a dosage rate of 10 kGy/h using a 60Co gamma source. Because the data of tracking resistance obtained from the tracking test has a wide variation, discharge current in the test is considered as a main factor to estimate the tracking resistance. A recurrence plot analysis of discharge current has been made to evaluate the tracking resistance more consistently. Obtained results showed that after gamma-ray irradiation, the tracking resistance was improved compared with that of the unirradiated sample. The tracking resistance showed an increasing tendency from 0 kGy to 100 kGy but a decreasing tendency from 100 kGy to 1000 kGy. There was a threshold value for the tracking resistance around 100 kGy, which was related to the reaction of cross-linking and degradation. The topological structures of the recurrence plots with the irradiated samples were different from that of the unirradiated one. There were bigger white space segments, which indicated that there were high amplitude transients in the discharge currents of unirradiated sample. The recurrence point density increased from 100 kGy to 1000 kGy, which suggested that the discharge process of the total dose at 1000 kGy was more intensive than that at 100 kGy. The irradiation effects on the tracking resistance can be visually identified by the recurrence plot.},

It has been previously identified that breathing dynamics are governed by a non-linear controller which implies the need for a nonlinear analytical tool. Further, it has been shown that quantified nonlinear variables are different between adult sleep states. This study aims to determine whether a nonlinear analytical tool known as recurrence plot analysis can characterize breath intervals of active and quiet sleep states in infants. Overnight polysomnograms were obtained from 32 healthy infants. The 6 longest periods each of active and quiet sleep were identified and a software routine extracted inter-breath interval data for recurrence plot analysis. Determinism (DET), laminarity (LAM) and radius (RAD) values were calculated for an embedding dimension of 4, 6, 8 and 16, and fixed recurrence of 0.5, 1, 2, 3.5 and 5{\%}. Recurrence plots exhibited characteristically different patterns for active and quiet sleep. Active sleep periods typically had higher values of RAD, DET and LAM than for quiet sleep, and this trend was invariant to a specific choice of embedding dimension or fixed recurrence. These differences may provide a basis for automated sleep state classification, and the quantitative investigation of pathological breathing patterns.},

RP and RQA are good at working with non-stationarity and noisy data, in detecting changes in data behavior, in particular in detecting breaks, like a phase transition and in informing about other dynamic properties of a time series. Endogenous Stock Market Crashes have been modeled as phase changes in recent times. Motivated by this, we have used RP and RQA techniques for detecting critical regimes preceding an endogenous crash seen as a phase transition and hence give an estimation of the initial bubble time. We have used a new method for computing RQA measures with confidence intervals. We have also used the techniques on a known exogenous crash to see if the RP reveals a different story or not. The analysis is made on Nifty, Hong Kong AOI and Dow Jones Industrial Average, taken over a time span of about 3 years for the endogenous crashes. Then the RPs of all time series have been observed, compared and discussed. All the time series have been first transformed into the classical momentum divided by the maximum Xmax of the time series over the time window which is considered in the specific analysis. RPs have been plotted for each time series, and RQA variables have been computed on different epochs. Our studies reveal that, in the case of an endogenous crash, we have been able to identify the bubble, while in the case of exogenous crashes the plots do not show any such pattern, thus helping us in identifying such crashes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Second, it is shown that the determinism measure introduced by the recurrence plot quantification depends on the control parameter as a decreasing exponential. The test of the results is performed by analyzing the determinism measure for type 1 intermittency observed in the logistic map.

METHODS A parameter describing the average length of vertical line structures in recurrence plots is calculated at a time resolution of 1 s as 'instantaneous trapping time'. Threshold comparison of this parameter is used to detect ongoing CSA. In data from 26 patients (duration 208 h) we assessed sensitivity for detection of CSA and mixed apnea (MSA) events by comparing the results obtained from 8-channel Holter ECGs to the annotations (860 CSA, 480 MSA) of simultaneously registered polysomnograms. RESULTS Multivariate combination of the EDR from different ECG leads improved the detection accuracy significantly. When all eight leads were considered, an average instantaneous vertical line length above 5 correctly identified 1126 of the 1340 events (sensitivity 84{\%}) with a total number of 1881 positive detections. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that recurrence plot analysis is a promising tool for detection and delineation of CSA epochs from EDR signals with high time resolution. Moreover, the approach is likewise applicable to directly measured respiratory signals.},

The e-learning system is a virtual place where thousands of dynamical systems (users) communicate each others. These communication leads to changes of users' activities. The users (human) behaviour is nonlinear (Sulis et al., 1995), therefore we can say that LMS is a virtual platform of interaction of nonlinear dynamical systems (Ignatowska et al., 2005; Ignatowska et al., 2008). In case of LMS system the number of logs of each user is one of the measures of his activity. The dynamics of changes of logs to LMS have been analyzed in the paper using the recurrence plot method. The analyses carried out in the paper have shown that recurrence plots are useful in exploring e-learning system dynamics. The comparison between the results of e-learning courses evaluation made by students and RP analysis allow us to withdraw the following conclusion: the increase of complexity and difficulty of the course causes the increase of RR coefficient.},

Computer systems behave non-linearly because they run many programs on multi-user operating systems; this causes inter-program dependencies requiring non- linear methods to analyse gathered data.

This article presents analysis of system activity through usage of series of recurrence plots to detect changes introduced by user actions. Analysis of lengths of horizontal and vertical lines on recurrence plots allows for describing periodicity of the system. This allows for gaining insight into behaviour of entire computing environment. Article shows that different tasks (such as network transmission, writing or reading from CD-ROM, compressing data) result in different recurrence plots; at the same time changes introduced by those tasks are hard to detect without analysis data.

Predicting the onset of paroxysmal AF (PAF), based on noninvasive techniques, is clinically important and can be invaluable in order to avoid useless therapeutic intervention and to minimize risks for the patients. In this paper, we propose an effective PAF predictor which is based on the analysis of the RR-interval signal. This method consists of three steps: preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. In the first step, the QRS complexes are detected from the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and then the RR-interval signal is extracted. In the next step, the recurrence plot (RP) of the RR-interval signal is obtained and five statistically significant features are extracted to characterize the basic patterns of the RP. These features consist of the recurrence rate, length of longest diagonal segments (L(max )), average length of the diagonal lines (L(mean)), entropy, and trapping time. Recurrence quantification analysis can reveal subtle aspects of dynamics not easily appreciated by other methods and exhibits characteristic patterns which are caused by the typical dynamical behavior. In the final step, a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier is used for PAF prediction. The performance of the proposed method in prediction of PAF episodes was evaluated using the Atrial Fibrillation Prediction Database (AFPDB) which consists of both 30 min ECG recordings that end just prior to the onset of PAF and segments at least 45 min distant from any PAF events. The obtained sensitivity, specificity, positive predictivity and negative predictivity were 97{\%}, 100{\%}, 100{\%}, and 96{\%}, respectively.

As it was initially developed for the study of dynamical systems, and was later used in nonlinear time series analysis, the question of using it as a signal processing tool has not been put into discussion yet. In this field the projective techniques are largely used, with good results. Nevertheless, they also have some limitations - especially regarding transient signal processing. But this kind of signals are ubiquitous in real world. In addition, propagation through various media as well as on multiple paths lead to delayed, attenuated and dilated versions of the original transients. In this paper we study the behaviour of the recurrence plot analysis method in the context of analyzing some finite duration signals being subject to rescalings of the amplitude and time axes. This study is a starting point in employing the analysis of recurrences in investigations of a large class of real world signals.},

This method consists of four steps: Preprocessing, feature extraction, feature reduction, and classification. In the first step, the QRS complexes are detected from the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and then the HRV signal is extracted.

These features consist of length of longest diagonal segments, average length of the diagonal lines, entropy, trapping time, length of longest vertical line, and recurrence trend. In the third step, these features are reduced to three features by the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) technique. Using LDA not only reduces the number of the input features, but also increases the classification accuracy by selecting the most discriminating features.

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to evaluate rolling bearing defect severity based on Recurrence Plot (RP) entropy. As a quantitative measure, the RP entropy is calculated from the probability distribution of the diagonal line length in the recurrence plot, where such plot graphically depicts a system's dynamics and provides a global picture of the autocorrelation in a time series over all available time-scales, in the reconstructed phase space, to characterize changing dynamics of the system. The experimental results have indicated that, as the working condition of the bearing deteriorates due to the initiation and/or progression of the structural damages, the frequency information contained in the vibration signal becomes increasingly complex, leading to the increase of the RP entropy. Therefore, the RP entropy can serve as an effective parameter for defect severity evaluation of rolling bearings. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recently, the concept of phase synchronization of two weakly coupled oscillators has raised a great research interest and has been applied to characterize synchronization phenomenon in physiological data. Phase synchronization of cardiorespiratory coupling is often studied by a synchrogram analysis, a graphical tool investigating the relationship between instantaneous phases of two signals. Although several techniques have been proposed to automatically quantify the synchrogram, most of them require a preselection of a phase-locking ratio by trial and error. One technique does not require this information; however, it is based on the power spectrum of phase's distribution in the synchrogram, which is vulnerable to noise. This study aims to introduce a new technique to automatically quantify the synchrogram by studying its dynamic structure. Our technique exploits recurrence plot analysis, which is a well-established tool for characterizing recurring patterns and nonstationarities in experiments. We applied our technique to detect synchronization in simulated and measured infants' cardiorespiratory data. Our results suggest that the proposed technique is able to systematically detect synchronization in noisy and chaotic data without preselecting the phase-locking ratio. By embedding phase information of the synchrogram into phase space, the phase-locking ratio is automatically unveiled as the number of attractors.},

Patterns within RP of the fluidized bed were classified into two groups of local white areas (LWA), showing macro structures, and local bold areas (LBA), showing meso and micro structures. These patterns showed that the fluidized bed system has three different hydrodynamic behaviors as superficial gas velocity increases; at low gas velocities, macro structures become more dominant, further increase in gas velocity empowers influence of finer structures on the hydrodynamic and finally the fluidization regime changes. Additionally, these results were confirmed by recurrence rate (RR) and average cycle frequency. Comparison of RP of the fluidized bed with Lorenz and complete stochastic systems showed that the fluidized bed is more complex than Lorenz system, however, it's hydrodynamic has not stochastic nature. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Detection of PD poses many problems in terms of speed of calculation and selection criteria, due to the nature of PD spectrum (frequency varying from a few hundreds of kilohertz up to hundreds of megahertz) and multitude of causes which lead to the occurrence of PD. These challenges take a great toll on the computing capability of today's PD detection systems. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we have developed an algorithm which uses the spectrogram to perform a fast detection of parts from the signal which are susceptible of partial discharge (PD) activity. The second stage calculates for each zone a detection curve using the HOS concept of bispectrum and RPA. The latter has been applied in many non-linear systems in order to characterize the process on the basis of the recurrence matrix obtained from a time series given by the system. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

The height of dual-leg is 0.16m. The glass beads with diameters of 0.25-0.28mm were adopted as bed material. The results show that the RP could be utilized effectively to explain the nonlinear dynamic performance in the DL-FB and the chaos of the DL-FB is higher than that of the single distributor FB because of the combination of bubbling actions and solids exchange behavior between two half beds. With the increase of fluidization velocity, entropy as a recurrence quantification parameter varies along with a M-type curve at different fluidization velocities. Four processes were shown for the gas-solids flow in the DL-FB with the increase of the fluidization velocity lower fluidization velocity with no particles exchange, less solids exchange at lower fluidization velocity, solids exchange and particles dispersion. The trend of the effect of bed inventory on entropy is not obvious.},

Phase space reconstruction is a proper method to analysis this problem but there are two problems which block its usage in engineer project. One of them is how to determine the key parameters which will affect the result of phase space reconstruction. The other is how to express the reconstructed space. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to determine the parameters, delay time and embedded dimension, and introduce recurrence plot to describe the phase space. In specific, the new algorithm is a revised G-P algorithm by introducing B-spline method. Meanwhile we set another acceleration transducer to catch the background signal which is used to determine the threshold of drawing recurrence plot. These two changes will overcome the subjectivity of former algorithms of choosing parameters. Finally, a case is studied to test the validity of the new algorithm by using vibration signal of faulty rolling element bearing.},

The aim of this work is to use recurrence-based measures in an attempt to improve the classification performance obtained with a classical spectral approaches for a fivecommand SSVEP-BCI system. For both recurrence and spectral spaces, features were selected using a cluster measure defined by the Davies-Bouldin index and the classification stage was based on linear discriminant analysis. As the main result, it was found that the threshold $\epsilon$ of the recurrence plot, chosen so as to yield a recurrence rate of 2.5{\%}, defined the key discriminant feature, typically providing a mean classification error of less than 2{\%} when information from 4 electrodes was used. Such classification performancewas significantly better than that attained using spectral features, which strongly indicates that RQA is an efficient feature extraction technique for BCI.},

abstract = {Metal cutting is a complex nonlinear dynamical process. Analysis of signals from turning operation shows that the machining exhibits a low-dimensional chaos. The self-excited vibration caused by the regenerative effect, usually called chatter, can be created during machining by increasing one cutting parameter, while keeping all other cutting parameters constant. A cross-recurrence plot (CRP) enables the study of synchronisation or time differences in two time series. CRP-based methodology is used to find the point of transition from normal cutting to chatter cutting. In this method, two signals, one input signal (power to the lathe motor) and one output signal (cutting tool vibration), are recorded simultaneously at a constant sampling rate during cutting. A time series is generated from the recorded values, and cross-recurrence plot is prepared. This CRP can be quantified using Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA). Abrupt variation in the CRQA parameters indicates the onset of chatter vibration. The results are verified using permutation entropy (PE) to detect the onset of chatter from the time series. The present study ascertains that this CRP-based methodology is capable of recognising the transition from regular cutting to the chatter cutting irrespective of the machining parameters or work piece material.},

abstract = {Structures in recurrence plots (RPs), preserving the rich information of nonlinear invariants and trajectory characteristics, have been increasingly analyzed in dynamic discrimination studies. The conventional analysis of RPs is mainly focused on quantifying the overall diagonal and vertical line structures through a method, called recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). This study extensively explores the information in RPs by quantifying local complex RP structures. To do this, an approach was developed to analyze the combination of three major RQA variables: determinism, laminarity, and recurrence rate (DLR) in a metawindow moving over a RP. It was then evaluated in two experiments discriminating (1) ideal nonlinear dynamic series emulated from the Lorenz system with different control parameters and (2) data sets of human heart rate regulations with normal sinus rhythms (n = 18) and congestive heart failure (n = 29). Finally, the DLR was compared with seven major RQA variables in terms of discriminatory power, measured by standardized mean difference (DSMD). In the two experiments, DLR resulted in the highest discriminatory power with DSMD = 2.53 and 0.98, respectively, which were 7.41 and 2.09 times the best performance from RQA. The study also revealed that the optimal RP structures for the discriminations were neither typical diagonal structures nor vertical structures. These findings indicate that local complex RP structures contain some rich information unexploited by RQA. Therefore, future research to extensively analyze complex RP structures would potentially improve the effectiveness of the RP analysis in dynamic discrimination studies.},

Non-stationary signals are present in real-life phenomena such as underwater mammal's vocalizations, human speech, ultrasonic monitoring, detection of electrical discharges, transients, wireless communications, etc. This is why a large number of approaches for non-stationary signal analysis are developed such as wavelet analysis, higher order statistics, or quadratic time-frequency analysis. Following the context, the methods defined around the concept of Recurrence Plot Analysis (RPA) constitute an interesting way of analyzing non-stationary signals and, particularly, the transient ones. Starting from the phase space and the recurrence matrix, new approaches [the angular distance, recurrence-based autocorrelation function (ACF), average-magnitude difference function (AMDF) and time-distributed recurrence (TDR)] are introduced in order to extract information about the non-stationary signals, specific to different applications. Comparisons with existing analysis methods are presented, proving the interest and the potential of the RPA-based approaches.},

abstract = {Previous studies have indicated that the chronic effects of exposure to low-frequency noise causes annoyance. However, during the past two decades, most studies have employed questionnaires to characterize the effects of noise on psychosomatic responses. This study investigated cardiovascular activity changes in exposure to low-frequency noise for various noise intensities by using recurrence plot analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) estimation. The authors hypothesized that distinct noise intensities affect cardiovascular activity, which would be reflected in the HRV and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) parameters. The test intensities of noises were no noise, 70-dBC, 80-dBC, and 90-dBC. Each noise level was sustained for 5 min, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded simultaneously. The cardiovascular responses were evaluated using RQA of the beat-to-beat (RR) intervals obtained from ECG signals. The results showed that the mean RR interval variability and mean blood pressure did not substantially change relative to the noise levels. However, the length of the longest diagonal line (L{\textless}inf{\textgreater}max{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) of the RQA of the background noise (no noise) condition was significantly lower than the 70-dBC, 80-dBC, and 90-dBC noise levels. The laminarity showed significant changes in the noise levels of various intensities. In conclusion, the RQA-based measures appear to be an effective tool for exposure to low-frequency noise, even in short-term HRV time series. {\textcopyright} (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The peripheral blood volume is another variable of the cardiovascular control system with a crucial role during active standing since re-distribution of blood volume is necessary to counteract the gravity force and to provide enough blood supply to vital organs. Beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic systolic blood volume (SBV) oscillations may be useful to study the cardiovascular control if it is considered as a regulatory system with relevant local differences compared to blood pressure regulation. There are no previous reports of the SBV dynamical response to active standing. In this work we study simultaneously the dynamical response of heart-beat interval, SBP and SBV to active standing through comparison of RQA indexes evaluated during supine position and during active standing in 19 healthy volunteers. We show that in response to orthostatic stress, SBV oscillations have dynamic changes similar, but not identical, to SBP and the heart-beat interval. This suggests that these three variables are complementary for a better evaluation of the cardiovascular dynamics.},

A series of experimental tests in this study show that the dynamical characteristics of sEMG data with recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) can distinguish different hand grasp movements. Meanwhile, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is applied to evaluate the performance of the aforementioned measures to identify the grasp movements. The experimental results show that the recognition rate (99.1{\%}) based on the combination of linear and nonlinear measures is much higher than those with only linear measures (93.4{\%}) or nonlinear measures (88.1{\%}).

abstract = {Question: In recent years, it is reported that brain activity is not originated from the region by itself, but originated from several regions. In this study, we examined the functional connectivity among the three regions in both hemispheres, (1) pre-motor area and supplementary motor area, (2) primary motor area and (3) primary sensory area on performing motor execution or imagery. Methods: NIRS refers Near Infra-red spectroscopy, with which the brain activity can be measured non-invasively and low-restrictedly. Using a few wavelengths of near infra-red light, the relative hemoglobin concentration changes evoked by the brain activity can be measured. Recently, many studies have been reported in clinical cases such as rehabilitation or psychic medicine. In this research, we detect the functional connectivity in NIRS data using joint recurrence plot (Marwon, 2007). Recurrence plot is one of the useful method in time series analysis, which visualize the inner structure of a time series. Moreover, joint recurrence plot detects the relationships between two time series by a statistical method (Iwayama, 2012). Eleven normal subjects (age: 23-36years) participated in the examination. All of them were judged as the right-handed with Edinburgh handedness inventory. With pacing visual stimuli, subjects are instructed to execute grasping or to image grasping hands during task periods. A session consists of pre-task (20s), task (20s) and post-task (20s). Session was repeated five times in each measurement. All experiment were performed according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and under the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Tokyo Denki University. Written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects after the explanation of the natural and possible consequences of the study. Results and conclusions: In motor imagery task, the functional connectivity are significantly larger in the premotor cortex and the supplementary cortex between both hemispheres. On the other hand, no significant difference in functional connectivity is found in motor execution. Our study shows that joint recurrence plot can be a useful tool for detecting functional connectivity on-line, therefore, it could contribute the rehabilitation or the brain machine interface.},

Little work, however, has been reported in the literature on using a recurrence plot method to analyze the vibration signal for damage detection. In this paper, we develop a recurrence plot based fault detection method by integrating the statistical process control technique. The recurrence plots of the vibration signals are derived by using the recurrence plot (RP) method. Five types of features are extracted from the recurrence plots to quantify the vibration signals' characteristic. Then, the T{\^{}}2 control chart, a multivariate statistical process control technique, is used to monitor these features. The T{\^{}}2 control chart technique, however, has the assumption that all the data should follow a normal distribution. The RP based T{\^{}}2 bootstrap control chart is proposed to estimate the control chart parameters. The performance of the proposed RP based T{\^{}}2 bootstrap control chart is evaluated by a simulation study and compared with other univariate bootstrap control charts based on recurrence plot features. A real case study of rolling element bearing fault detection demonstrates that the proposed fault detection method achieves a very good performance.},

All of these cell lines produced growth factor activity for IL-6-dependent hybridoma cells (7TD1), which was completely neutralized by the monoclonal anti-IL-6-antibody 6B4. IL-6 expression was also evident at the mRNA level using a murine IL-6-specific cDNA probe. In 32Dcl.23 cells (2 x 10(5)/ml) stimulated for 24 hr with serial dilutions of purified murine IL-3, a positive correlation was found between the IL-3 dose and the amount of IL-6 measured in the conditioned media. At 24 hr this correlation was not evident at the mRNA level. However, prolonged exposure of 32Dcl.23 cells (up to 72 hr) to either a high (60 U/ml) or a low IL-3 concentration (1 U/ml) revealed a time-dependent increase and decrease, respectively, of IL-6 mRNA levels. At both IL-3 concentrations 32Dcl.23 cells remained in a fully viable and proliferative state. The influence of IL-3 on IL-6 release could be specifically counteracted by anti-IL-3-antiserum. IL-6 added alone or in concert with IL-3 did not stimulate 32Dcl.23 proliferation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {An experiment and a time series analysis have been made on the flow in a rectangular natural convection loop. It was found that the flow reversal occurs in a certain range of the heat flux and Reynolds number, which depends on the cooling water temperature. Based on time series temperature data of the system, an attractor in a state space has been reconstructed. Geometrical structures and orbital instability for this attractor were evaluated by the recurrence plot analysis and a nonlinear prediction by the method of local linear approximation. A nonlinear prediction was applied to the turbulence time series. As a result, a recurrence plot of the predicted time series obtained from the turbulence data has characteristics similar to those of the measured of the unstable flow. This fact suggests that, even when an apparent turbulent flow is observed, a transition to the unstable flow may occur. In order to confirm this conjecture, we have performed another experiment with the addition of a disturbance to the loop. The experimental results are consistent with the chaos analysis. We have successfully shown the validity of the nonlinear prediction and its recurrence plot as a means to evaluate dynamical flow instability.},

It is observed that the flow field and heat transfer rate are influenced by the variations of Reynolds, Hartmann and Strouhal numbers. Furthermore, recurrence plot analysis is applied for the analysis of the time series (spatial averaged Nusselt number along the bottom wall downstream of the step) and for a combination of different parameters, the systems are identified using recurrence quantification analysis parameters including recurrence rate, laminarity, determinism, trapping time and entropy.},

abstract = {Currently, heart rate variability (HRV) is commonly evaluated using time and frequency domain analysis in the clinical practice. Due to the fact that cardiovascular system is regulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) that also influences HRV, however exhibits rather nonlinear behaviour, it appears more appropriate to apply nonlinear methods to evaluate functioning of ANS. This study presents recurrence analysis as a tool to test the presence of ANS dysfunction that is responsible i.e. for orthostatic (vasovagal) syncope by which abnormal HRV has been demonstrated in the past. Study included 18 patients that experienced vasovagal syncope (mean age 23.7 ± 5.2 years) and 18 healthy subjects (mean age 24.5 ± 3.2, p = 0.85). In all tested subjects, ECG recording was performed during active orthostatic test that comprised two phases (5 min of resting in a supine position and 5 min of active standing). Sequence of R-R intervals (time intervals between two consecutive heart beats derived from ECG) was analysed using standard time (mean RR, mean HR, SDNN, SDHR, RMSSD, NN50 and pNN50) and frequency domain (LF, HF and LF/HF ratio) analysis. Moreover, recurrence analysis was performed (RATIO, DIV, AVDL, MAXV, DET, ENTR, LMAX, TT and LAM). Frequency domain analysis did not demonstrate significant difference between the two groups in any of the parameters during both phases of the test. On the contrary, both time domain analysis and recurrence analysis showed comparable findings in both groups during resting phase of the orthostatic test with a significant change of most tested parameters after stand-up. As the use of time domain HRV may be perceived as problematic regarding their interpretation in short ECG recordings, recurrence analysis appears to be a sensitive tool for detecting ANS dysfunction in patients with vasovagal syncope.},

abstract = {In progressive stamping processes, condition monitoring based on tonnage signals is of great practical significance. One typical fault in progressive stamping processes is a missing part in one of the die stations due to malfunction of part transfer in the press. One challenging question is how to detect the fault due to the missing part in certain die stations as such a fault often results in die or press damage, but only provides a small change in the tonnage signals. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel automatic process monitoring method using the recurrence plot (RP) method. Along with the developed method, we also provide a detailed interpretation of the representative patterns in the recurrence plot. Then, the corresponding relationship between the RPs and the tonnage signals under different process conditions is fully investigated. To differentiate the tonnage signals under normal and faulty conditions, we adopt the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to characterize the critical patterns in the RPs. A parameter learning algorithm is developed to set up the appropriate parameter of the RP method for progressive stamping processes. A real case study is provided to validate our approach, and the results are compared with the existing literature to demonstrate the outperformance of this proposed monitoring method.},

Dual eye tracking data for twenty two dyad teams were recorded during a laparoscopic task and then the teams were divided into good performer and poor performer teams based on the task times. Eventually we studied the de- lay between two team members for good and poor performer teams. The results indicated that the good performer teams show a smaller delay comparing to poor performer teams.

Data were chosen from eight patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. MERs for interictal and ictal data were calculated and compared. A statistical test was performed to evaluate the ability of MER to separate the interictal state from the ictal state. MER showed significant changes from the interictal state into the ictal state, where MER was low at the ictal state and is significantly different with that at the interictal state. These suggest that MER is able to separate the ictal state from the interictal state based on ECoG data.

abstract = {The dynamics of a protein and the water surrounding it are coupled via
nonbonded energy interactions. This coupling can exhibit a complex,
nonlinear, and nonstationary nature. The THz frequency spectrum for this
interaction energy characterizes both the vibration spectrum of the
water hydrogen bond network, and the frequency range of large amplitude
modes of proteins. We use a Recurrence Plot based Wiener-Khinchin method
RPWK to calculate this spectrum, and the results are compared to those
determined using the classical auto-covariance-based Wiener-Khinchin
method WK. The frequency spectra for the total nonbonded interaction
energy extracted from molecular dynamics simulations between the
-Lactamase Inhibitory Protein BLIP, and water molecules within a 10
angstrom distance from the protein surface, are calculated at 150, 200,
250, and 310 K, respectively. Similar calculations are also performed
for the nonbonded interaction energy between the residues 49ASP, 53TYR,
and 142PHE in BLIP, with water molecules within 10 angstrom from each
residue respectively at 150, 200, 250, and 310 K. A comparison of the
results shows that RPWK performs better than WK, and is able to detect
some frequency data points that WK fails to detect. This points to the
importance of using methods capable of taking the complex nature of the
protein-solvent energy landscape into consideration, and not to rely on
standard linear methods. In general, RPWK can be a valuable addition to
the analysis tools for protein molecular dynamics simulations. Proteins

Firstly, the non stationary characteristics and other characteristics of the typical time series of hurricane Gustavo (2008) were obtained by utilizing phase space reconstruction techniques and recurrence plot theory. Thereafter, 6 recurrence quantification indexes were imported, which were recurrence rate, determinism, entropy, average diagonal line length, laminarity and trapping time and quantifies the signal characteristics of hurricane in the whole process of making landing, and defines one boundary for every index between hurricane signal and normal wind signal. Lastly, the procedure and all the indexes defined are verified by typhoon Muifa (1109). The result shows that the early hurricane has certain periodicity and stationarity; however, the non linearity and non stationary are particularly salient for the middle hurricane; 6 indexes can distinguish the signal characteristics between hurricane and normal wind; recurrence quantification analytical procedure completely suitable for the wind signal researches, and can fully describe the nonstationary characteristics of wind signals.},

abstract = {Effect of temperature on the hydrodynamics of bubbling gas–solid fluidized beds was investigated using recurrence plot (RP) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) due to their capabilities for determining the whole bed complexity in a simple way. For this purpose, pressure fluctuations of a fluidized bed of sand particle were measured at various gas velocities and temperatures. Recurrence quantification analysis showed that by increasing the temperature up to 300 °C, both determinism and laminarity increase due to formation of larger bubbles whereas entropy and recurrence rate decrease. To better detecting the different structures of in the bed recurrence plot at higher temperature, pressure fluctuations were also decomposed through wavelet transform. It was shown that at low gas velocity, the macro structures became dominate with increasing the bed temperature due to increase in the rate of bubble coalescence. The bubble diameter was estimated from the incoherent component of the cross power spectra of pressure signals at various temperatures and velocities. The incoherent results and standard deviation of measured pressure fluctuations confirmed that by increasing the bed temperature up to 300 °C, bubbles grow up to a maximum diameter, after which they became smaller. In addition, the trend of the largest positive Lyapunov exponent was estimated through the recurrence plot patterns. It was shown that a bubbling fluidized bed is a chaotic system at higher temperatures. It was found a maximum in the estimated largest positive Lyapunov exponent at 300 °C corresponds to the larger bubbles.},

abstract = {To accurately classify and identify different human gait signals, recurrence plot and recurrence quantification analysis are proposed to calculate the complexity of nonlinear time series underlying human gait stride interval. The appropriate delay time and embedding dimension are respectively calculated by methods of the mutual information and the false nearest neighbours. One dimension time series is extended to high dimension phase space by employing phase space reconstruction principle for studying the distribution regularity and movement characteristic of neighboring points in time series. The recurrence plots of gait signals from Parkinson's disease elders, healthy elders and youth are established for intuitively and qualitatively analyzing and evaluating their distribution state. It is observed that the space distribution of healthy subjects is more complex than others. Moreover, the complexity of human gait is quantified by recurrence quantification analysis. The computation results show that gait complexity of subjects with Parkinson's disease is less than healthy youth and elders, and independent sample t-test also exhibits their significant difference for distinct classification. Consequently, the proposed method is easy and feasible for classifying the subjects with different ages and Parkinson's disease. It is also helpful to human health monitoring and diagnosis.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} T{\"{U}}BİTAK. In this paper we present a method to predict sudden cardiac death (SCD) based on the heart rate variability (HRV) signal and recurrence plots and Poincar{\'{e}} plot-extracted features. This work is a challenge since it is aimed to devise a method to predict SCD 5 min before its onset. The method consists of four steps: preprocessing, feature extraction, feature reduction, and classification. In the first step, the QRS complexes are detected from the electrocardiogram signal and then the HRV signal is extracted. In the second step, the recurrence plot of the HRV signal and Poincar{\'{e}} plot-extracted features are obtained. Four features from the recurrence plot and three features from the Poincar{\'{e}} plot are extracted. The features are recurrence rate, determinism, entropy and averaged diagonal line length, and SD1, SD2, and SD1/SD2. In the next step, these features are reduced to one feature by the linear discriminant analysis technique. Finally, K-nearest neighbor and support vector machine-based classifiers are used to classify the HRV signals. We use two databases, the MIT/BIH Sudden Cardiac Death Database and PhysioBank Normal Sinus Rhythm Database. We manage to predict SCD occurrence 5 min before the SCD with accuracy of over 92{\%}.},

@article{Sipers2017c,
abstract = {To make valid inferences from recurrence plots for time-delay embedded signals, two underlying key questions are: (1) to what extent does an unthresholded recurrence (URP) plot carry the same information as the signal that generated it, and (2) how does the information change when the URP gets distorted. We studied the first question in our earlier work [1], where it was shown that the URP admits the reconstruction of the underlying signal (up to its mean and a choice of sign) if and only if an associated graph is connected. Here we refine this result and we give an explicit condition in terms of the embedding parameters and the discrete Fourier spectrum of the URP. We also develop a method for the reconstruction of the underlying signal which overcomes several drawbacks that earlier approaches had. To address the second question we investigate robustness of the proposed reconstruction method under disturbances. We carry out two simulation experiments which are characterized by a broad band and a narrow band spectrum respectively. For each experiment we choose a noise level and two different pairs of embedding parameters. The conventional binary recurrence plot (RP) is obtained from the URP by thresholding and zero-one conversion, which can be viewed as severe distortion acting on the URP. Typically the reconstruction of the underlying signal from an RP is expected to be rather inaccurate. However, by introducing the concept of a multi-level recurrence plot (MRP) we propose to bridge the information gap between the URP and the RP, while still achieving a high data compression rate. We demonstrate the working of the proposed reconstruction procedure on MRPs, indicating that MRPs with just a few discretization levels can usually capture signal properties and morphologies more accurately than conventional RPs.},

abstract = {The generalized recurrence plot is a modern tool for quantification of complex spatial patterns. Its application spans the analysis of trabecular bone structures, Turing patterns, turbulent spatial plankton patterns, and fractals. Determinism is a central measure in this framework quantifying the level of regularity of spatial structures. We show by basic examples of fully regular patterns of different symmetries that this measure underestimates the orderliness of circular patterns resulting from rotational symmetries. We overcome this crucial problem by checking additional structural elements of the generalized recurrence plot which is demonstrated with the examples. Furthermore, we show the potential of the extended quantity of determinism applying it to more irregular circular patterns which are generated by the complex Ginzburg-Landau-equation and which can be often observed in real spatially extended dynamical systems. So, we are able to reconstruct the main separations of the system's parameter space analyzing single snapshots of the real part only, in contrast to the use of the original quantity. This ability of the proposed method promises also an improved description of other systems with complicated spatio-temporal dynamics typically occurring in fluid dynamics, climatology, biology, ecology, social sciences, etc.},

The increasing availability of highly resolved spatio-temporal data leads to new opportunities as well as challenges in many scientific disciplines such as climatology, ecology or epidemiology. This allows more detailed insights into the investigated spatially extended systems. However, this development needs advanced techniques of data analysis which go beyond standard linear tools since the more precise consideration often reveals nonlinear phenomena, for example threshold effects. One of these tools is the recurrence plot approach which has been successfully applied to the description of complex systems. Using this technique's power of visualization, we propose the analysis of the local minima of the underlying distance matrix in order to display driving forces of spatially extended systems. The potential of this novel idea is demonstrated by the analysis of the chlorophyll concentration and the sea surface temperature in the Southern California Bight. We are able not only to confirm the influence of El Ni{\~{n}}o events on the phytoplankton growth in this region but also to confirm two discussed regime shifts in the California current system. This new finding underlines the power of the proposed approach and promises new insights into other complex systems.},

The growing volume of theoretical knowledge about systems dynamic's offered researchers the opportunity to look for non-linear dynamics in data whose evolution linear models are unable to explain in a satisfactory manner. One of the most recent approach in this respect is Recurrence Analysis - RA. It is a graphical method designed to locate hidden recurring patterns, nonstationarity and structural changes. RA approach have first been applied in natural sciences like physics and biology. Quickly, was adopted in economics and engineering. Meanwhile, the fast development of computer resources has provided powerful tools to perform this new and complex model. One free software which we used to perform the analysis is Visual Recurrence Analysis - VRA developed by Eugene Kononov. As is presented in this paper, the recurrence plot investigation for the analyzing of the gasoline engine shows some of the its capabilities in this domain. We chose two specific engine parameters measured in two different tests to perform the RPA. These parameters are ignition angle and engine angular speed. There were computed graphs for each of them. Graphs were analyzed and compared to obtain a conclusion. This work is an incipient research, being one of the first attempt of using recurrence plot for analyzing automotive dynamics.

This induced noise is known to cause disrupted and deviated diagonal lines despite the known deterministic features and, hence, biases the diagonal line based RQA measures and can lead to misleading conclusions. Although discontinuous lines can be further connected by increasing the recurrence threshold, such an approach triggers thick lines in the plot. However, thick lines also influence the RQA measures by artificially increasing the number of diagonals and the length of vertical lines [e.g., Determinism ( D E T) and Laminarity ( L A M) become artificially higher]. To take on this challenge, an extended RQA approach for accounting disrupted and deviated diagonal lines is proposed.

The wavelet packet transform was first used to extract the integer approximation and detailed information from the pressure signals. Then, the energy distributions in each frequency band were calculated and the corresponding dynamical characteristics were obtained using a recurrence plot. It was found that the highest pumping efficiency under the slug-churn flow condition is caused by the highest mean pressure. In addition, the energy of the slug-churn flow regime has a dramatic increase in the frequency band of 31.25–62.5 Hz, due to the burst of big Taylor bubbles. In the low-frequency band (0–31.25 Hz), the pressure shows a chaotic behavior due to the turbulence of liquid flow. In the frequency band of 31.25–62.5 Hz, the pressure executes a transition from chaotic fluctuation in slug flow to periodic fluctuation in slug-churn due to the linear motion of small bubbles.},

The MIT-BIH database was used for designing the samples of the study. The 5 minutes ECG signals of the SCD patients which were 1 hour before the SCD onset and just 5 min before the SCD onset were pre-processed for noise removal and RR-interval extraction. The RR-intervals were then processed to obtain a set of non- linear features using recurrence plots. These fea-tures were checked for correlation among the SCD patients using Spearman's function of correlation. The classification of the optimal features into normal control subjects and SCD was implemented us-ing classifier k-Nearest Neighbor or k-NN classifier. A maximum accuracy of 98.44{\%} was obtained using k-NN. The results indicate that, the proposed algorithm can efficiently identify the person at risk of progressive SCD 1 hour before, which would be helpful in supporting sufficient time for the medical staff attending the patient to respond with preventive treatment.},
