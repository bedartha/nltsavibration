abstract = {The chapter deals with autoparametric vibrations of a system composed of a nonlinear oscillator with an attached pendulum. Dynamics of the mechanical structure is studied analytically around the principal parametric resonance region, numerically and experimentally for a wide range of parameters. The influence of damping, nonlinear stiffness (hard and soft), amplitude and frequency of excitation on the system's behaviour is analysed in details. The obtained results show that the pendulum can be applied as a dynamical absorber. However, for selected parameters, near the main parametric resonance, instability, which transits the pendulum to chaotic oscillations or to a full rotation, occurs. Therefore, the application of a magnetorheological (MR) damper and a nonlinear spring is proposed to improve the dynamics and to control the response online. Periodic vibrations, chaotic motions or a full rotation of the pendulum obtained numerically are confirmed by the experiment. The chaotic nature of motion is determined from real signals by the attractor reconstruction and the recurrence plot calculation. The results show that the semi-active suspension may reduce dangerous motion and it also allows to maintain the pendulum at a given attractor or to jump to another one.},

abstract = {Real-world data streams may change their behaviors along time, what is referred to as concept drift. By detecting those changes, researchers obtain relevant information about the phenomena that produced such streams (e.g. temperatures in a region, bacteria population, disease occurrence, etc.). Many concept drift detection algorithms consider supervised or semi-supervised approaches which tend to be unfeasible when data is collected at high frequencies, due to the difficulties involved in labeling. Complementarily, current studies usually assume data as statistically independent and identically distributed, disregarding any temporal relationship among observations and, consequently, risking the quality of data modeling. In order to tackle both aspects, we employ dynamical system modeling to represent the temporal relationships among data observations and how they modify along time in attempt to detect concept drift. This approach considers Taken's immersion theorem to unfold consecutive windows of data observations into the phase space in attempt to represent and compare time dependencies. From this perspective, we proposed four new concept drift detection algorithms based on the unsupervised machine learning paradigm. The first algorithm builds dendrograms of consecutive phase spaces (every phase space represents the time relationships for the observations contained in a particular data window) and compare them out by using the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, providing enough guarantees to detect concept drifts. The second algorithm employs the Cross Recurrence Plot and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis to detect relevant changes in consecutive phase spaces and warn about relevant data modifications. We also preprocess data windows by considering the Empirical Mode Decomposition method and Mutual Information in attempt to take only the deterministic stream behavior into account. All algorithms were implemented as plugins for the Massive Online Analysis (MOA) software and then compared to well-known algorithms from literature. Results confirm the proposed algorithms were capable of detecting most of the behavior changes, creating few false alarms.},

This paper presents a review of some energetic, spectral and spatio-temporal characteristics of the Kamchatkan volcanic earthquakes of the first group and their relationship with volcanic phenomena. Seismicity related to volcanic activity has the following specific features: a local and predominantly swarm-like pattern of earthquake origination; iteration of earthquake swarms in the same seismically active zones; many shallow and relatively small events; a small magnitude limit (up to 5.5-6); the existence of longer-period variations of volcanic earthquake foci as compared to the tectonic one; and a comparatively high value of the slope of the earthquake recurrence plot. At the same time, similarity in behaviour of some parameters of the seismic regime during the preparation and development of eruptions and prior to large earthquakes, as well as the destruction of samples, are noted. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Physiological systems are best characterized as complex dynamical processes that are continuously subjected to and updated by nonlinear feedforward and feedback inputs. System outputs usually exhibit wide varieties of behaviors due to dynamical interactions between system components, external noise perturbations, and physiological state changes. Complicated interactions occur at a variety of hierarchial levels and involve a number of interacting variables, many of which are unavailable for experimental measurement. In this paper we illustrate how recurrence plots can take single physiological measurements, project them into multidimensional space by embedding procedures, and identify time correlations (recurrences) that are not apparent in the one-dimensional time series. We extend the original description of recurrence plots by computing an array of specific recurrence variables that quantify the deterministic structure and complexity of the plot. We then demonstrate how physiological states can be assessed by making repeated recurrence plot calculations within a window sliding down any physiological dynamic. Unlike other predominant time series techniques, recurrence plot analyses are not limited by data stationarity and size constraints. Pertinent physiological examples from respiratory and skeletal motor systems illustrate the utility of recurrence plots in the diagnosis of nonlinear systems. The methodology is fully applicable to any rhythmical system, whether it be mechanical, electrical, neural, hormonal, chemical, or even spacial.},

"Steady states" of activity can be achieved with light loads, but with heavy loads the dynamic system experiences continuous status transitions that culminate in task failure. The present study was designed to assess the applicability of two mathematical tools, one linear and the other nonlinear, in addressing the time course of EMG alterations under different loading challenges. Surface EMGs of the biceps brachii muscle were recorded from 14 healthy human volunteers during light and heavy loadings, and task failure occurred at varying times among the subjects. Digitized EMG signals were analyzed by linear spectral analysis (fast Fourier transform) and nonlinear recurrence-plot analysis. With light loading, computed variables from both analyses gave "quasi-steady-state" values over time, with recurrence-plot analysis having the higher variance. With heavy loading, the nonlinear variable ({\%}determinism) increased sooner and exhibited larger changes from control values than decreases in the linear variable (spectral center frequency). Experimental results support the conclusion that both analyses can be combined to give a fuller assessment of the biceps EMG during light or heavy loading. Implications for the detection of muscular fatigue are discussed.},

abstract = {The prevailing theoretical approach to variability and motor control of gait is to treat the within-subject variability as a reflection of noise in the sensorimotor system. Another way to conceptualize noise is to consider the sensorimotor system as a non-linear dynamic system. Here noise is viewed as part of the dynamics and not as superimposed components. Thus noise contributes to the qualitative properties of the dynamic output and not merely to the quantitative properties. This formulation holds the interesting property that noise can be beneficial to the system in the sense of facilitating the adaptation to task demands.With the help of two shoes with eight built-in force sensors and a portable data logger (InfotronicTM) we recorded vertical force peaks during healthy gait during a time interval of 160 s. The data allows assessment of the stationarity of the time series. The time demand to get a stable gait pattern was monitored in dependence on the gait velocity. The stationarity is characterized at first by the recurrence plot, a graphical tool for the diagnosis of drift and hidden periodicities. Further analysis is performed to discriminate between a noisy periodic signal and deterministic chaotic dynamics. The aim of the investigation is to introduce the fractal dimension of the time series of essential gait parameters for the assessment of a practical number of degrees of freedom in the motor control of gait.},

abstract = {The classical description of ventriculoarterial coupling by calculating the ratio between the effective arterial elastance Ea to the end-systolic elastance Ees does not give insight into the underlying dynamics of the interaction between left-ventricular pressure (LVP) and aortic pressure (AOP) and flow (AOF). The aim of this study was to introduce a state space representation for the ventriculoarterial coupling and to quantify changes of the coupling state. METHODS: A ventriculoarterial state space orbit VAO was defined to be dependent on three variables: VAO = [LVP(t), AOP(t + delta t), AOF(t + delta t)]. Changes in the coupling effect directly or indirectly on the time series of these parameters. They reflect the actual state of the cardiovascular system. The time delay delta t between the LVP and the aortic signals takes respect to the short delay between the heart action and the resulting waves in the arterial tree. The recurrence map of the VAO(i) (i = 1 .. N, N = number of points) is constructed by plotting the index i of every single point on the orbit (x-axis) against the indices of his 10 nearest neighbors (y-axis) in distance. The data were recorded in 9 anaesthetized pigs with a sample frequency of 512 Hz over a period of 6 seconds using piezoelectric pressure sensors and a Doppler flowmeter. A control condition was compared to a total occlusion of the descending aorta as a strong artificial disturbance of ventriculoarterial interaction. The nonlinear parameters percent recurrence, percent determinism and the entropy were calculated from the plot. RESULTS: Periodic crossing points and forbidden zones in all plots identify the nonlinear character of the chosen variables. The recurrent patterns are less rigid for control conditions than for total occlusion. Entropy (2.3{\%} rise) and determinism (24{\%} rise) are significantly (p {\textless} 0.003) increased. Total aortic occlusion leads to more complex time correlation patterns. CONCLUSIONS: These results may reflect the loss of an ideal coupling state leading to a more complex deterministic behavior of the overall regulatory system. Because recurrence plots do not impose rigid constraints on data set size, stationarity, or statistical distribution, we hypothesize that this technique might be useful to describe the nonlinear dynamics between left ventricle and arterial system.},

Sympathetic but not parasympathetic blockade reduced BP level and its LF component. RR increased and decreased after beta- and alpha-blockades, respectively. Hexamethonium increased HF, and atropine reduced LF, of RR. Sympathetic blockade and, in particular, alpha-sympathetic blockade increased nonlinear indexes of BP. In contrast, parasympathetic blockade by atropine increased nonlinear indexes of RR. These results suggest that, compared with spectral indexes, nonlinear indexes may be more specific markers of sympathetic and parasympathetic tones.},

We used nonlinear methods to get a deeper insight on the effects of clonidine on blood pressure dynamics. For 24 h and 4 wk, clonidine (0.1 mg . kg-1 . day-1 sc) was infused by minipumps in the conscious SHRs, and, for comparison, a vehicle was infused in SHRs and in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Blood pressure was recorded for 30 min before and after treatments. We used the Lyapunov exponent, approximated by the inverse of the lmax index derived from the recurrence plot method, to characterize nonlinear dynamics. Before treatment, lmax index of blood pressure was lower (P {\textless} 0.01) in the SHRs than in the Wistar-Kyoto rats. Clonidine significantly increased lmax (P {\textless} 0.01) to the level observed in normotensive rats, at 24 h and up to 4 wk after infusion. We conclude that clonidine has a significant chronic effect on blood pressure dynamics, as evidenced by nonlinear methods. Our study also suggests that the mechanisms governing blood pressure variations are nonlinear.},

In this paper, one of the possible applications of recurrence plot strategy to the analysis of sEMG is described. Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is an efficient time-series analysis tool pertaining to the class of non-linear dynamics time-domain processing. We analysed sEMG recorded on the biceps brachii during isometric contraction both at constant (CF) and non constant force (NCF). For comparison purposes, experimental data were analysed over epochs of 1 s so that the hypothesis of sEMG stationarity could be accepted. The analysis concerned one of the most widely used frequency parameters (namely the median frequency, MDF) and one parameter (i.e., the percent determinism {\%}DET) extracted using the non-linear technique. Our main results are: (i) the gross average evaluated for all subjects on {\%}DET data shows a comparable variation with respect to MDF throughout the course of CF experiments; (ii) {\%}DET seems able to detect motor unit (MU) synchronisation; (iii) during non constant force experiments, {\%}DET is more effective than MDF in detecting sEMG changes determined by brisk transients of force output.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) time series of VF is investigated by comparison of the linear and non-linear features of VF time series and surrogates in which internal correlations have been destroyed. From 40 ECG time series of human VF and 40 surrogate time series, three quantities are evaluated: the percentage of the linear time-frequency distribution (TFD) exceeding a threshold, the non-linear coarse-grained correlation dimension (Dcg), and the percentage of diagonal lines in the non-linear recurrence plot longer than 10 elements (D10). It is found that the mean (SD) percent threshold TFD and Dcg are higher for the surrogates (6.7{\%} (1.3) and 5.3 (0.6)) than the VF time series (5.6{\%} (0.7) and 3.8 (0.9)), whereas the mean D10 is higher for the VF time series (49{\%} (13)) than the surrogates (32{\%} (7)). All of these differences are significant (p {\textless} 0.0001) and indicate greater order in the VF time series than in the surrogates. It is therefore shown that both linear and non-linear signal analysis demonstrate order in the ECG time series of VF.},

We performed both linear and nonlinear analyses based on the cross correlation function (CCF) and recurrence plot quantification (RPQ), respectively. Recurrence plots were quantified by three variables: percent recurrence (PR), percent determinism (PD), and entropy of recurrences (ER). We recorded bipolar intra-atrial electrograms in two atrial sites during chronic AF in 19 informed subjects, following two protocols. In one, both recording sites were in the right atrium; in the other protocol, one site was in the right atrium, the other one in the left atrium. We extracted 19 episodes of type I AF (Wells' classification). RPQ detected transient recurrent patterns in all the episodes, while CCF was significant only in ten episodes. Surrogate data analysis, based on a cross-phase randomization procedure, decreased PR, PD, and ER values. The detection of spatiotemporal recurrent patterns together with the surrogate data results indicate that during AF a certain degree of local organization exists, likely caused by deterministic mechanisms of activation.},

abstract = {Using a portable ECG data logger, heart rate variability (HRV) in horses was measured under controlled- (resting-), mental stress- and physical stress conditions. Time domain-, frequency domain- and non-linear parameters were used to describe the variations in the HRV. Simple linear parameters like SDANN and RMSSD can demonstrate that there are differences in HRV between resting conditions, mental- and physical-stress conditions but do not give an explanation about the underlying mechanisms. Fourier analysis with calculation of low and high frequency bands gives further information: physical stress is characterised by an increase in sympathetic tone and a decrease in parasympathetic tone - a fact which is commonly accepted. No differences could be found between resting conditions and mental stress. Summarising the results of non-linear recurrence plot variables, it seems, that during different physiological states the organism shifts between various control strategies. Under resting conditions a kind of deterministic-chaotic control is preferred which changes to more strict periodic control under physical stress. Mental stress seems to be characterised by a more random influenced control which means more or less loss of control over the heart rate variability. },

abstract = {Objective: Testing the hypothesis that alterations in non-linear dynamics of the cardiovascular variability appear in healthy, awake subjects during voluntary apnea. Subjects and Methods: Ten young subjects performed 20 apneas 60 s each separated by 1 min free breathing. Inter-beat interval (IBI) measured as RR-interval in ECG, systolic (SYS) and diastolic (DIAS) arterial blood pressure, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were non-invasively recorded and computed by Portapress 2 system. Correlation dimension according to Grassberger-Proccacia algorithm (CD) and ratio of {\%} determinism versus {\%} recurrence (RDR) computed from recurrence plot according to Webber and Zbiluth [J. Appl. Physiol. 76 (1994) 965] were used as the indices of chaos and complexity. Sequential time series of cardiovascular variables in consecutive 60-s apneas and inter-apnea free breathings were separately windowed and aggregated. CD and RDR of aggregated apneic time series were compared with CD and RDR values of aggregated time series of inter-apnea free breathing, 10 min at rest and 10 min recovery. Reliability of the aggregation method of sequential time series was tested on transformed simulated data generated by Lorenz model. Error in CD and RDR estimation did not exceed 5{\%} and 1{\%}, respectively. Results: CD of cardiovascular variables computed from aggregated apneas was significantly reduced and RDR augmented versus control and recovery periods. CD and RDR values of inter-apnea phases were in between those in control and during apneas. Time domain linear variance (SD) was increased during aggregated apneas. Conclusions: Signal dynamics dependent windowing and data aggregation could be a useful tool for non-linear analysis of short repeatable sequential time series; time domain linear variability of the cardiovascular dynamics is augmented while complexity reduced during apneic chemoreceptor stimulation; alterations in non-linear dynamics of cardiovascular variables during apneas in healthy normotensive subjects may suggest an early sign of a mechanism implicated in arterial hypertension in OSAS.

In conscious SHR, sympathetic but not parasympathetic blockade reduced BP level and LF-BP, and increased nonlinear indexes of BP. RR increased after beta-sympathetic and ganglionic blockade, decreased after parasympathetic blockade, and remained unchanged after alpha(1)-sympathetic blockade. SD-RR decreased after ganglionic and alpha(1) blockade, whereas HF-RR increased after beta-sympathetic blockade.

abstract = {Procedures of nonlinear parameter estimation require large samples of data. In stationary physiological situations, usually short time series are available. The method of dynamics-dependent windowing and data aggregation procedure are proposed. This technique was tested on chaotic signal generated by Lorenz model and applied to investigate beat-to-beat control of the cardiovascular system in 10 healthy volunteers. Nonivasively recorded blood pressure, respiratory activity and blood oxygen saturation were digitized and saved for further off-line analysis. The experimental procedure consisted of 10 min control-C, 20 voluntary apneas 1 min each-A, interapnea 20 periods of 1 min spontaneous breathing-B, and 10 min free-breathing recovery-R. Respiration signal served as a reference for apnea and interapnea free-breathing identification period. Correlation dimension-CD, according to Grassberger and Procaccia, and recurrence plot strategy, according to Webber and Zbilut, were applied to check dynamical properties of the signals. Results of numerical experiment on Lorenz model, original and transformed by segmentation and aggregation, support our assumption of similarity of their dynamics. Error in CD and recurrence parameters estimation strongly depended on segment length and was about 5{\%} for 600 to 1200 data points. However, even for segments of 75 to 100 samples, it did not exceed 10{\%} for all, but one, periodic testing signal. Segmentation and aggregation applied to interbeat interval (IBI) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) data showed that CD and recurrence variables estimated separately for apneic and interapneic period and those calculated for mixed (apneic and interapneic) intervals were different. Average CD and recurrence parameters of IBI and TPR for 10 subjects during apnea and interapnea intervals were significantly different than during control and recovery. The lowest CD (mean±S.D.) of 6.38±0.4, 5.62±0.2 and {\%}recurrence 10.35±0.8, 6.62±0.6 (highest ratio 4.95±0.2, 5.13±0.3) were observed in apnea for IBI and TPR, respectively. Low values of the estimates computed for mixed periods may suggest the influence of slowly varying, quasiperiodic driving force due to experimental procedure regime.

While several linear approaches are often insufficient to describe such processes, there are several nonlinear methods which however require rather long time observations. To overcome these difficulties, we propose measures of complexity based on vertical structures in recurrence plots and apply them to the logistic map as well as to heart rate variability data. For the logistic map these measures enable us not only to detect transitions between chaotic and periodic states, but also to identify laminar states, i.e. chaos-chaos transitions. The traditional recurrence quantification analysis fails to detect the latter transitions. Applying our new measures to the heart rate variability data, we are able to detect and quantify the laminar phases before a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia occurs thereby facilitating a prediction of such an event. Our findings could be of importance for the therapy of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.},

abstract = {The method of recurrence plots is extended to the cross recurrence plots (CRP) which, among others, enables the study of synchronization or time differences in two time series. This is emphasized in a distorted main diagonal in the cross recurrence plot, the line of synchronization (LOS). A non-parametrical fit of this LOS can be used to rescale the time axis of the two data series (whereby one of them is compressed or stretched) so that they are synchronized. An application of this method to geophysical sediment core data illustrates its suitability for real data. The rock magnetic data of two different sediment cores from the Makarov Basin can be adjusted to each other by using this method, so that they are comparable.},

abstract = {Purchasing power parity (PPP) is an important theory at the basis of a large number of economic models. However, the implication derived from the theory that real exchange rates must follow stationary processes is not conclusively supported by empirical studies. In a recent paper, Serletis and Gogas [Appl. Finance Econ. 10 (2000) 615] show evidence of deterministic chaos in several OECD exchange rates. As a consequence, PPP rejections could be spurious. In this work, we follow a two-stage testing procedure to test for nonlinearities and chaos in real exchange rates, using a new set of techniques designed by Webber and Zbilut [J. Appl. Physiol. 76 (1994) 965], called recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Our conclusions differ slightly from Serletis and Gogas [Appl. Finance Econ. 10 (2000) 615], but they are also supportive of chaos for some exchange rates. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

We give a criterion to choose the threshold $\epsilon$ needed for the optimal computation of the recurrence plot (RP). One important point is to show the limits of interpretability of the results of the RQA if it is applied to measured time series. We show that even though the RQA is very susceptible to observational noise, it can yield reliable results for an optimal choice of $\epsilon$ if the noise level is not too high.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of heart rate variability (HRV) and its specific parameters as a new approach to assess stress load in cattle. We recorded HRV in 52 calves in three groups and in 31 cows in two groups. In calves we divided Group 1 with no obvious stress load (n=18), Group 2 with external stress load (n=17), and Group 3 with internal stress load from sickness (n=17). In cattle we divided lactating cows (n=21) and nonlactating cows (n=10). HRV parameters were analyzed in the time domain and in the frequency domain. Moreover, we applied Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to quantify nonlinear components of HRV. In calves, linear HRV parameter decreased from Group 1 to Group 3 (P{\textless}.05). However, not a single parameter showed significant differences regarding all three groups. The value of all nonlinear measurements increased at the same time (P{\textless}.05). The only parameter that exhibited significant differences between all three groups was the longest diagonal line segment in the recurrence plot (LMAX) which is inversely related to the Lyapunov exponent. We did not find differences concerning the linear HRV parameters between the two groups in the cows. The nonlinear parameter Determinism showed significant higher values in lactating cows compared to nonlactating cows. The importance of particular HRV-parameters was tested by applying a discriminant analysis approach. In calves and cattle nonlinear parameters were most important to indicate the level of stress load on the animals. Based on the results we assume HRV to be a valuable physiological indicator for stress load in animals. Whereas linear parameters of HRV are supposed to be useful to separate qualitative different level of stress, nonlinear components of HRV distinguish quantitative different challenges for the animals. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The best cut-off differentiating CFS from the control population was FRAS = + 0.22. FRAS {\textgreater} + 0.22 was associated with CFS (sensitivity 70 {\%} and specificity 88 {\%}). The cardiovascular reactivity received mathematical expression with the aid of the FRAS. The shortened HUTT was well tolerated.

First pub-lished August 9, 2002; 10.1152/japplphysiol.00314.2002.— Amplitude and frequency content of the surface electromyographic (EMG) signal reflect central and periph-eral modifications of the neuromuscular system. Classic sur-face EMG spectral variables applied to assess muscle func-tions are the centroid and median power spectral frequencies. More recently, nonlinear tools have been introduced to ana-lyze the surface EMG; among them, the recurrence quantifi-cation analysis (RQA) was shown to be particularly promis-ing for the detection of muscle status changes. The purpose of this work was to analyze the effect of motor unit short-term synchronization and conduction velocity (CV) on EMG spec-tral variables and two variables extracted by RQA, the per-centage of recurrence ({\%}Rec) and determinism ({\%}Det). The study was performed on the basis of a simulation model, which allowed changing the degree of synchronization and mean CV of a number of motor units, and of an experimental investigation of the surface EMG signal properties detected during high-force-level isometric fatiguing contractions of the biceps brachii muscle. Simulations and experimental results were largely in agreement and show that 1) spectral variables, {\%}Rec, and {\%}Det are influenced by CV and degree of synchro-nization; 2) spectral variables are highly correlated with {\%}Det (R ϭ Ϫ0.95 in the simulations and Ϫ0.78 and Ϫ0.75 for the initial values and normalized slopes, respectively, in the exper-imental signals), and thus the information they provide on muscle properties is basically the same; and 3) variations of {\%}Det and {\%}Rec in response to changes in muscle properties are significantly larger than the variations of spectral variables. This study validates RQA as a means for fatigue assessment with potential advantages (such as the higher sensitivity to changes of muscle status) with respect to the classic spectral analysis. surface electromyography; motor unit short-term synchroni-zation; surface electromyographic modeling; recurrence plot analysis THE SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC (EMG) signal presents smaller bandwidth with respect to the intramuscular},

As we have found the simple deterministic chaos is not likely explanation for the time variability of inter-beat intervals, which must be considered as a mixture of deterministic and stochastic chaos. We have demonstrated that the data obtained from old subjects have a more deterministic origin and the data obtained from young subjects are more random and complex. The complex dynamics of the healthy heart-beat arise from numerous coupled control systems and feedback loops that regulate the cardiac cycle on different time scales. Aging has a profound impact on many of the interacting neural and endocrine mechanisms that regulate heart rate, which may explain why the heart-rate time series looses much of its complex, irregular behavior.},

Seven horses performed six exercise tests with different work loads (walking (x = 1.56 +/- 0.08 m/s) and trotting (x = 2.9 +/- 0.13 m/s): dry, water above the carpus and water above the elbow). The standardized test-protocol was: 5 min warm-up at walk while the water was pumped in, followed by the 20-min exercise period at walk or trot, followed by a 5-min walk while pumping out the water. Blood samples were taken prior to each test at rest in the stable, as well as exactly 5 min after the end of the 20-min exercise period. Electrocardiograms were recorded during rest and the 20-min exercise period. Compared to rest, neither the chosen velocities, the two water levels, nor the dry tests led to a significant increase of the lactic acid concentration in any horse. The haemoglobin content showed a significant increase as a result of exercise. Significant differences could be found between the heart rates at rest and the six exercise tests and between the mean of the levels 'walking' and the mean of the levels 'trotting'. An exercise-induced change of HRV was characterized by a decreasing SDNN, a significantly higher LFnorm (sympathetic influence) combined with a significantly lower HF(norm) power (parasympathetic activity) and a rising degree of order (significantly higher {\%} determinism and nearly unchanged {\%} recurrence) and stability (significantly rising ratio(corr)) of the recurrence plot. In conclusion, the used training-protocol for aqua-treadmill exercises only represents a medium-sized aerobic work load for horses, but the different levels of burden were indicated especially by changes in HRV.},

We apply the proposed methods to various data such as chaotic and stochastic time series, and compare IDNP with the method proposed by Wayland et al. for recognizing determinism.

abstract = {The ability to accurately classify and identify the network traffic associated with different applications is a central issue for many network operation and research topics including Quality of Service enforcement, traffic engineering, security, monitoring and intrusion-detection. However, traditional classification approaches for traffic to higher-level application mapping, such as those based on port or payload analysis, are highly inaccurate for many emerging applications and hence useless in actual networks. This paper presents a recurrence plot-based traffic classification approach based on the analysis of non-stationary "hidden" transition patterns of IP traffic flows. Such nonlinear properties cannot be affected by payload encryption or dynamic port change and hence cannot be easily masqueraded. In performing a quantitative assessment of the above transition patterns, we used recurrence quantification analysis, a nonlinear technique widely used in many fields of science to discover the time correlations and the hidden dynamics of statistical time series. Our model proved to be effective for providing a deterministic interpretation of recurrence patterns derived by complex protocol dynamics in end-to-end traffic flows, and hence for developing qualitative and quantitative observations that can be reliably used in traffic classification.},

abstract = {The reports dealing with the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on brain electrical activity have been inconsistent. We suspected that the use of linear methods and models accounted for some of the variability, and we explored the issue by using a novel approach to study the effects of EMFs on the electroencephalogram (EEG) from rabbits. The EEG was embedded in phase space and local recurrence plots were calculated and quantified to permit comparisons between exposed and control epochs from individual animals. Statistically significant alterations in brain activity were observed in each animal (n=10) when it was exposed to 2.5 G, 60 Hz, as assessed using each of two recurrence-plot quantifiers. Each result was replicated; a positive-control procedure ruled out the possibility that the effect of the field was a product of the method of analysis. Measurements performed while the rabbits were under anesthesia suggested that the effect was mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate and/or $\alpha$2-adrenoceptors. No differences were found between exposed and control epochs in any animal when the experiment was repeated after the rabbits had been killed, indicating that a putative interaction between the field and the EEG electrodes could not account for the observed effects. We conclude that EMF transduction resulting in changes in brain electrical activity could be demonstrated consistently using a nonlinear method of analysis. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The ability to accurately classify and identify the network traffic associated with different applications is a central issue for many network operation and research topics including Quality of Service enforcement, traffic engineering, security, monitoring and intrusion-detection. However, traditional classification approaches for traffic to higher-level application mapping, such as those based on port or payload analysis, are highly inaccurate for many emerging applications and hence useless in actual networks. This paper presents a recurrence plot-based traffic classification approach based on the analysis of non-stationary "hidden" transition patterns of IP traffic flows. Such nonlinear properties cannot be affected by payload encryption or dynamic port change and hence cannot be easily masqueraded. In performing a quantitative assessment of the above transition patterns, we used recurrence quantification analysis, a nonlinear technique widely used in many fields of science to discover the time correlations and the hidden dynamics of statistical time series. Our model proved to be effective for providing a deterministic interpretation of recurrence patterns derived by complex protocol dynamics in end-to-end traffic flows, and hence for developing qualitative and quantitative observations that can be reliably used in traffic classification.},

Analysis performed put in evidence that the emitted vocalization becomes more irregular and aperiodic with the increase of the pain suffered by the newborn. We think that this phenomenon can be explained by taking into account some behaviors observed in the model by Ishizaka and Flanagan of the vocal folds. Chaotic behaviors have been found in the cries of healthy infants as well as infants with several perinatal complications. We show that these phenomena also appear in healthy infants and are related to the newborn's pain intensity. Under the point of view of the dissipative systems, pain acts as a bifurcation parameter for the motion of the vocal folds. These hypothesis are supported by the recurrence plot analysis performed on the cries and, in particular the shape and the patterns observed in the plots are typical of chaotic transitions observed in dissipative systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Is it useful to further analyse foetal heart rate to improve the prediction of pregnancy complications? The analysis of the foetal heart rate is usually based on the variability of the heart rate, i. e. the more variable the heart rate presents - except a decrease - the better the condition of the foetus is. The same concept is applied in our own analysis which differs only in the presentation of the data. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed 25 non-stress-tests from unselected third trimester pregnancies using sophisticated software. The recurrence plot (RP) is able to rearrange data from foetal heart rate monitoring in order to make the heart rate variability visible. We developed criteria for a normal and an abnormal test result describing the structure of the diagram to predict an uneventful and a high-risk pregnancy, respectively. RESULTS: 11 out of 11 patients with uneventful course and outcome of pregnancy showed a coarse and blurred RP pattern. 12 out of 14 (86 {\%}) patients developing either intrauterine growth retardation or preeclampsia and requiring caesarean section because of foetal heart rate abnormalities showed a fine and clear RP pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results show that it makes sense to further evaluate foetal heart rate variability in order to predict pregnancy complications. Computer programs including the algorithms needed (calculation of the recurrence plot) are not expensive and easy to handle. A widespread use of these programs represents the basis requirement for large controlled clinical trials},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aberrations of cardiovascular reactivity (CVR), an expression of autonomic function, occur in a number of clinical conditions, but lack specificity for a particular disorder. Recently, a CVR pattern particular to chronic fatigue syndrome was observed. Aim: To assess whether specific CVR patterns can be described for other clinical conditions. METHODS: Six groups of patients, matched for age and gender, were evaluated with a shortened head-up tilt test: patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (n = 20), non-CFS fatigue (F) (n = 15), neurally-mediated syncope (SY) (n = 21), familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) (n = 17), psoriatic arthritis (PSOR) (n = 19) and healthy subjects (H) (n = 20). A 10-min supine phase was followed by recording 600 cardiac cycles on tilt (5-10 min). Beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) and pulse transit time (PTT) were measured. Results were analysed using conventional statistics, recurrence plot analysis and fractal analysis. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis evaluated independent predictors of the CVR in each patient group vs. all other groups. Based on these predictors, equations were determined for a linear discriminant score (DS) for each group. The best sensitivities and specificities of the DS, consistent with disease-related phenotypes of CVR, were noted in the following groups: CFS, 90.0{\%} and 60{\%}; SY, 93.3{\%} and 62.5{\%}; FMF, 90.1{\%} and 75.4{\%}, respectively. DISCUSSION: Pathological disturbances may alter cardiovascular reactivity. Our data support the existence of disease-related CVR phenotypes, with implications for pathogenesis and differential diagnosis.},

abstract = {Recent studies in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats show that some nonlinear indexes derived from the recurrence plot method may be better markers of sympathetic activity than the spectral powers of blood pressure (BP). We herein investigated the relationships between nonlinear indexes and plasma noradrenaline concentration in conscious WKY rats and SHRs. Blood pressure was recorded for 30 min after intravenous injection of saline (0.9{\%} NaCl, 100 microL/kg), hexamethonium (20 mg/kg), atropine (0.5 mg/kg), atenolol (1 mg/kg) or prazosin (1 mg/kg). Spectral power in the low-frequency (LF) band and the nonlinear index (L(max)), calculated on diastolic (DBP) and systolic blood pressures (SBP), were used to analyse the BP signal. Noradrenaline concentration was determined by radioenzymatic technique. A robust stepwise regression analysis - using noradrenaline concentration as dependent variable, and LF, L(max) and treatment, as independent variables -shows that treatment is the main variable explaining the variance of noradrenaline level in WKY rats, excluding the use of the pooled data to explore the relationship between noradrenaline concentration and LF or L(max). In contrast, in SHRs, treatment has no effect on the variance of noradrenaline concentration and the pooled data were then used. In this group, no correlation was observed between noradrenaline concentration and LF. In contrast, very high positive correlation was observed between noradrenaline level and L(max)-DBP (r = 0.59; P = 0.0005) or L(max)-SBP (r = 0.53; P {\textless} 0.002). The results strengthen our previous suggestion that nonlinear indexes may be better tools than spectral powers to investigate the sympathetic nervous system.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an online sleep apnea detection method based on heart rate complexity as measured by recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) statistics of heart rate variability (HRV) data. RQA statistics can capture nonlinear dynamics of a complex cardiorespiratory system during obstructive sleep apnea. In order to obtain a more robust measurement of the nonstationarity of the cardiorespiratory system, we use different fixed amount of neighbor thresholdings for recurrence plot calculation. We integrate a feature selection algorithm based on conditional mutual information to select the most informative RQA features for classification, and hence, to speed up the real-time classification process without degrading the performance of the system. Two types of binary classifiers, i.e., support vector machine and neural network, are used to differentiate apnea from normal sleep. A soft decision fusion rule is developed to combine the results of these classifiers in order to improve the classification performance of the whole system. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better classification results compared with the previous recurrence analysis-based approach. We also show that our method is flexible and a strong candidate for a real efficient sleep apnea detection system.},

abstract = {A catalog of moment magnitudes M-W is constructed for the strongest earthquakes on Kamchatka over the period from 1737 through 2000. Macroseismic evidence and tsunami data were used for historical earthquakes, and the M-W value for earthquakes of the 20th century was estimated through other magnitudes either with the use of nonlinear intermagnitude relations or directly from M-0. Recurrence plots were constructed on an M-W scale for the time periods 1923-1952, 1952-1962, and 1963-1988. Year-averaged estimates of numbers n(6) of shocks with M-W greater than or equal to M-WO = 6.0 obtained for various time intervals differ appreciably. The function logn(M)(M-W) is approximately linear in the range M-W = 5.5-7, where the recurrence plot slope is b = 0.95-1.1. Several variants of the recurrence "prediction" of the strongest earthquakes (M-W = 9) are constructed from 116 and b data assuming that the recurrence plot is linear. Comparison of these predictions with the actual data over 264 years showed that the observed recurrence rate significantly (by a factor of up to 5) exceeds any predicted variants obtained by a linear extrapolation of the MW = 5.5-7 recurrence plot. Thus, the hypothesis on the linearity of the recurrence plot is at variance with our data, and the recurrence of moderate shocks appreciably fluctuates with time. The deviation of the recurrence plot from linearity has a pattern consistent with the model of a characteristic earthquake. Methodologically, the results presented in this paper imply that empirical estimates of the recurrence of moderate events made for various time intervals can differ substantially, and the application of the hypothesis on the recurrence plot linearity tends to significantly underestimate the recurrence of the strongest events.},

An application of this method to geophysical sediment core data illustrates its suitability for real data. The rock magnetic data of two different sediment cores from the Makarov Basin can be adjusted to each other by using this method, so that they are comparable.},

abstract = {Background: Aberrations of cardiovascular reactivity (CVR), an expression of autonomic function, occur in a number of clinical conditions, but lack specificity for a particular disorder. Recently, a CVR pattern particular to chronic fatigue syndrome was observed. Aim: To assess whether specific CVR patterns can be described for other clinical conditions. Methods: Six groups of patients, matched for age and gender, were evaluated with a shortened head-up tilt test: patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (n=20), non-CFS fatigue (F) (n=15), neurally-mediated syncope (SY) (n=21), familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) (n=17), psoriatic arthritis (PSOR) (n=19) and healthy subjects (H) (n=20). A 10-min supine phase was followed by recording 600 cardiac cycles on tilt (5-10 min). Beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) and pulse transit time (PTT) were measured. Results were analysed using conventional statistics, recurrence plot analysis and fractal analysis. Results: Multivariate analysis evaluated independent predictors of the CVR in each patient group vs. all other groups. Based on these predictors, equations were determined for a linear discriminant score (DS) for each group. The best sensitivities and specificities of the DS, consistent with disease-related phenotypes of CVR, were noted in the following groups: CFS, 90.0{\%} and 60{\%}; SY, 93.3{\%} and 62.5{\%}; FMF, 90.1{\%} and 75.4{\%}, respectively. Discussion: Pathological disturbances may alter cardiovascular reactivity. Our data support the existence of disease-related CVR phenotypes, with implications for pathogenesis and differential diagnosis. {\textcopyright} Association of Physicians 2004; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Is it useful to further analyse foetal heart rate to improve the prediction of pregnancy complications? The analysis of the foetal heart rate is usually based on the variability of the heart rate, i. e. the more variable the heart rate presents - except a decrease - the better the condition of the foetus is. The same concept is applied in our own analysis which differs only in the presentation of the data. Material and Methods: We analysed 25 non-stress-tests from unselected third trimester pregnancies using sophisticated software. The recurrence plot (RP) is able to rearrange data from foetal heart rate monitoring in order to make the heart rate variability visible. We developed criteria for a normal and an abnormal test result describing the structure of the diagram to predict an uneventful and a high-risk pregnancy, respectively. Results: 11 out of 11 patients with uneventful course and outcome of pregnancy showed a coarse and blurred RP pattern. 12 out of 14 (86{\%}) patients developing either intrauterine growth retardation or preeclampsia and requiring caesarean section because of foetal heart rate abnormalities showed a fine and clear RP pattern. Conclusions: Our preliminary results show that it makes sense to further evaluate foetal heart rate variability in order to predict pregnancy complications. Computer programs including the algorithms needed (calculation of the recurrence plot) are not expensive and easy to handle. A widespread use of these programs represents the basis requirement for large controlled clinical trials.},

abstract = {Recurrence plots provide a graphical representation of the recurrent patterns in a timeseries, the quantification of which is a relatively new field. Here we derive analytical expressions which relate the values of key statistics, notably determinism and entropy of line length distribution, to the correlation sum as a function of embedding dimension. These expressions are obtained by deriving the transformation which generates an embedded recurrence plot from an unembedded plot. A single unembedded recurrence plot thus provides the statistics of all possible embedded recurrence plots. If the correlation sum scales exponentially with embedding dimension, we show that these statistics are determined entirely by the exponent of the exponential. This explains the results of Iwanski and Bradley [J.S. Iwanski, E. Bradley, Recurrence plots of experimental data: to embed or not to embed? Chaos 8 (1998) 861-871] who found that certain recurrence plot statistics are apparently invariant to embedding dimension for certain low-dimensional systems. We also examine the relationship between the mutual information content of two timeseries and the common recurrent structure seen in their recurrence plots. This allows time-localized contributions to mutual information to be visualized. This technique is demonstrated using geomagnetic index data; we show that the AU and AL geomagnetic indices share half their information, and find the timescale on which mutual features appear. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that these patterns are related to particular nonstationarities in the signal. Some of them can be reproduced by artificial signals like frequency modulated sinusoids and sinusoids with time divergent frequency. These modulations are too faint to be resolved by conventional time-frequency analysis with similar precision. Therefore, recurrence plots act as a magnifying glass for the detection of multiple temporal scales in slightly modulated signals. The detected phenomena in these acoustic signals can be explained in the biomechanical context by taking in account the role of the muscles controlling the vocal folds.},

The success of five commonly used schemes for estimating interplanetary propagation times is examined. Propagation assuming a fixed plane normal at 45 degrees to the GSE x-axis (i.e. the Parker Spiral estimate) is found to give optimal mutual information. The mutual information depends on the point in space chosen as the target for the propagation estimate, and we find that it is maximized by choosing a point in the nightside rather than dayside magnetosphere. In addition, we employ recurrence plot analysis to visualize contributions to the mutual information, this suggests that it appears on timescales of hours rather than minutes.},

METHODS: The study group included 30 women with FM, average age 46.7 years (SD 7.03). An age matched group of 30 women with other rheumatic disorders or having a dysautonomic background [chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), non-CFS fatigue, neurally mediated syncope, and psoriatic arthritis (PsA)] served as controls. Subjects were evaluated with a head-up tilt test with beat-to-beat recording of the heart rate (HR) and pulse transit time. A 10-minute supine phase was followed by 600 cardiac cycles recorded on tilt. Data were processed by recurrence plot and fractal analysis. Variables acting as independent predictors of the cardiovascular reactivity were identified in FM patients versus controls. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between the groups by univariate analysis comparing 92 variables of cardiovascular reactivity in FM patients compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Study of cardiovascular reactivity utilizing a head-up tilt test and processing the data using the FRAS method did not reveal a specific FM-associated abnormality. Our data confirm studies that utilized other methodologies and reached similar conclusions. Patients with FM represent a heterogenous group with respect to their pattern of cardiovascular reactivity.},

Two monitoring series were performed for approximately two weeks with a 5-second reading interval; thus, each series contains about 230,000 data points. The observed temperatures displayed sharp gradients and large fluctuations over all observed time ranges, reflecting fine structure of the heat transfer process in the shallow subsurface. Recurrence plot (RP) technique was applied for detecting hidden rhythms that generated the time series. The most characteristic feature of the RPs is their web-like structure, indicating quasi-periodic occurrence of the sharp changes. The spectral and the local growth of the second moment techniques were used for distinguishing between the potentially different heat transfer processes. Both spectra show "red noise" behavior, however, exhibit distinct scaling exponents for different frequency domains from near 1.33 for low frequencies to near 3 at the high frequency end of the spectra. Local growth of the second moment technique has revealed the presence of temperature forming process with the characteristic time of approximately 1 minute, that smoothes out generally anti-persistent behavior on shorter time scales, but has a little effect on longer time scales.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}The investigation was accomplished by the calculation of universal multifractal indices, which characterize temperature fluctuation upon scales in the range from minutes to weeks.

abstract = {This paper presents a recurrence plot scheme approach to the analysis of nonstationary transition patterns of IP-network traffic. In performing a quantitative assessment of dynamical transition patterns of IP-network traffic, we used the values of determinism (DET) defined by the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Also, in evaluating fractal-related properties of IP-network traffic, we employed the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), which is applicable to the analysis of long-range dependence (LRD) in nonstationary time-series signals. Furthermore, to obtain a comprehensive view of network traffic conditions, we used a self-organizing map, which provides a way to map high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional domain. When applying this method to traffic analysis, we performed two kinds of traffic measurement in Tokyo, Japan, and derived values of DET and the LRD-based scaling parameteralphaof IP-network traffic. Then, we found that the characteristic with respect to DET and self-similarity seen in the measured traffic fluctuated over time, with different time variation patterns for two measurements. In training the self-organizing map, we used three parameters: average throughput, variation ratio of DET, and {\&}alpha;-value. As a result, we visually confirmed that the traffic data could be projected onto the map in accordance with traffic properties, resulting in a combined depiction of the effects of the DET and network utilization rates on the time-variations of LRD.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in nonlinear analysis of respiratory sounds (RS), but little has been done to justify the use of nonlinear tools on such data. The aim of this paper is to investigate the stationarity, linearity and chaotic dynamics of recorded RS. Two independent data sets from 8 + 8 healthy subjects were recorded and investigated. The first set consisted of lung sounds (LS) recorded with an electronic stethoscope and the other of tracheal sounds (TS) recorded with a contact accelerometer. Recurrence plot analysis revealed that both LS and TS are quasistationary, with the parts corresponding to inspiratory and expiratory flow plateaus being stationary. Surrogate data tests could not provide statistically sufficient evidence regarding the nonlinearity of the data. The null hypothesis could not be rejected in 4 out of 32 LS cases and in 15 out of 32 TS cases. However, the Lyapunov spectra, the correlation dimension (D2) and the Kaplan-Yorke dimension (DKY) all indicate chaotic behavior. The Lyapunov analysis showed that the sum of the exponents was negative in all cases and that the largest exponent was found to be positive. The results are partly ambiguous, but provide some evidence of chaotic dynamics of RS, both concerning LS and TS. The results motivate continuous use of nonlinear tools for analysing RS data. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Knowledge of transitions from regular to chaotic behavior is essential to understand the underlying dynamics of nonlinear switching circuits. While linear approaches are often insufficient to describe such processes, there are nonlinear methods available but requires long time observations. To overcome these difficulties, a newly developed pattern recognition method of nonlinear dynamics called Recurrence plot analysis method is proposed to detect transitions between periodic and chaotic states. The recurrence plot is a two-dimensional representation technique that brings out distance correlations in a time series and make it instantly apparent whether a system is periodic or chaotic. In this paper, the proposed method is applied to a nonlinear switching Buck converter, Boost converter, and Buck-Boost converters to analyze their period doubling route to chaos behavior and to distinguish chaos from noisy behavior. This may lead to a better understanding of the nonlinear switching systems, that may allow us to design stable, chaotic free switching circuits.},

The subjects completed postural measurements with three levels of difficulty (rigid surface-eyes open, rigid surface-eyes closed, and foam surface-eyes closed). Four RQA measures ({\%} recurrence, {\%} determinism, entropy, and trend) were extracted from the recurrence plot. Relative reliability of these measures was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient and absolute reliability using standard error of measurement and coefficient of variation. {\%} Determinism and entropy were the most reliable features of RQA for the both intersession and intrasession reliability measures. High level of reliability of {\%} determinism and entropy in this preliminary investigation may show their clinical promise for discriminative and evaluative purposes of balance performance.},

abstract = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We have taken three prime quantification techniques namely Recurrence Rate, Entropy and Average Diagonal Length. The information about the system gets distributed in these quantities. Hence we need a model that is capable of taking into account the information from all the three RQA techniques. Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) can model these information very efficiently.

The dynamics of Li ions in lithium silicate glasses have been characterized by van-Hove functions, fractal dimension of random walks, multifractal analysis of density profile, and principal component analyses of time series. Hierarchy dynamics with local and successive jumps, which are followed by cooperative jumps involving more ions, are observed in the self-part of the van-Hove functions and in trajectories where they form a multifractal density profile. Fractal dimensions of the random walks can be used to characterize the motions of ions in both the short and long length-scale regions. Difference between them becomes clearer in the glassy state, and the corresponding power law dependences of the mean squared displacements can be well explained by these exponents. Phase-space plot using the de-noised data obtained by principal component analysis reveals that the trajectory extending from the short time to the long time dynamics in the plot is continuous and has long term memory. The motion examined by the principal component analysis of the time series shows the deterministic character of the single particle ion dynamics. Each ion moves among domains of collective motion. Recurrence plot and mutual information function shows long correlation of the dynamics. Therefore, the cause of the dynamic heterogeneity is rather deterministic in nature. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space.Apowerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plotwas introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series.A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research.We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of infants' spontaneous movements using dynamical systems analysis. The participants were 4 healthy full-term newborn infants, I month of age. A tri-axial accelerometer was used to measure limb acceleration in three-dimensional space. Acceleration signals were recorded on the right wrist when the infant was in an active alert state, lying supine. The recording time was 200 seconds, based on recommendations for the characteristics of this accelerometer. Digitized data were transferred to a PC for subsequent processing using analysis software. The time-series data, analyzed by linear and non-linear methods using the software package TISEAN, provided some evidence for a non-linear deterministic structure. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis suggested it to be largely a linear random process. Non-linear analysis (recurrence plot, maximal Lyapunov exponent and surrogate data), which facilitates hypothesis testing of dynamical measures, provided evidence that the infants' spontaneous movements had non-linear chaotic dynamic characteristics with 5 or 6 optimal embedding dimensions in structuring. The findings support the hypothesis that chaotic behavior dominates physiological systems, including neuronal networks. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

The proposed system has three different natures of equilibria: (i) saddle, (ii) saddle foci and (iii) stable node foci which is new in the literature. The system has invariant nature of the equilibria in the considered ranges of all five bifurcation parameters. The system has various complex dynamic behaviours like periodic (period-1, period-2, period-4), quasi-periodic, chaotic transient, stable and chaotic attractor. The system exhibits (i) inverse crises route to chaos for two bifurcation parameters and (ii) crises route to chaos for another three bifurcation parameters. It is observed that in case of normal parameter ranges, the trajectories of the system are concentrated only near an unstable equilibrium point, but in the transient chaotic parameters ranges the trajectories of the system switchover to a stable equilibrium point from the unstable equilibrium point. The transient chaotic nature of the system is analysed using the many numerical tools like Lyapunov exponents, instantaneous phase, Poincare return map, recurrence plot, 0–1 test analysis, autocorrelation plot. The findings of the numerical tools are validated using the circuit implementation.},

Current research into intrusion detection is notably focused on application behavior profiling through system call trace analysis. Studying the system call layer has been identified as a potential approach to render revealing details about an application's behavior. System call sequences available from the execution trace of an application can be subjected to different modeling techniques to approximate the application's normal execution. This research views application programs as dynamical systems, and applies dynamical system analysis tools operating on time series data, merely the system calls made by an application, to identify the degree of determinism in a dynamical system. There is some prior work in the literature analyzing programs as dynamical systems, but they lack proper utilization of dynamical system formalisms and associated analysis tools. In our research we utilize a set of dynamical system analysis tools composed of Approximate Entropy, Central Tendency Measure, and Recurrence Plot derived measures.

abstract = {Objective: Understanding the transition of brain activity towards an absence seizure is a challenging task. In this paper, we use recurrence quantification analysis to indicate the deterministic dynamics of EEG series at the seizure-free, pre-seizure and seizure states in genetic absence epilepsy rats. Methods: The determinism measure, DET, based on recurrence plot, was applied to analyse these three EEG datasets, each dataset containing 300 single-channel EEG epochs of 5-s duration. Then, statistical analysis of the DET values in each dataset was carried out to determine whether their distributions over the three groups were significantly different. Furthermore, a surrogate technique was applied to calculate the significance level of determinism measures in EEG recordings. Results: The mean (±SD) DET of EEG was 0.177 ± 0.045 in pre-seizure intervals. The DET values of pre-seizure EEG data are significantly higher than those of seizure-free intervals, 0.123 ± 0.023, (P {\textless} 0.01), but lower than those of seizure intervals, 0.392 ± 0.110, (P {\textless} 0.01). Using surrogate data methods, the significance of determinism in EEG epochs was present in 25 of 300 (8.3{\%}), 181 of 300 (60.3{\%}) and 289 of 300 (96.3{\%}) in seizure-free, pre-seizure and seizure intervals, respectively. Conclusions: Results provide some first indications that EEG epochs during pre-seizure intervals exhibit a higher degree of determinism than seizure-free EEG epochs, but lower than those in seizure EEG epochs in absence epilepsy. Significance: The proposed methods have the potential of detecting the transition between normal brain activity and the absence seizure state, thus opening up the possibility of intervention, whether electrical or pharmacological, to prevent the oncoming seizure. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics theory has been a tool of choice in the analysis of physiological signals and systems. This paper presents a novel approach in the analysis of tracheal swallowing and breath sounds based on nonlinear dynamics theory. As the tracheal sound signal is nonstationary, the signal was studied based on the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) method, which is a useful technique in the analysis of nonstationary and noisy signals. Tracheal sound recordings of 15 healthy and 9 dysphagic subjects were studied. The multidimensional state space trajectory of each signal was reconstructed using Taken's method of delays. The reconstructed trajectories were analyzed by the RQA technique. The preliminary results suggested that some recurrence parameters were appreciably different between swallowing and breath sounds. In order to confirm discriminating ability of the parameters, an automated method for extraction of swallowing sounds in the records of the tracheal swallowing and breath sounds was investigated. The swallowing sound extraction results were validated by manual inspection of the simultaneously recorded airflow signal and spectrogram of the sounds and also by auditory means. Experimental results proved that the investigated method more accurately detected the boundaries of swallowing sounds than methods proposed previously. Swallowing sound detection may be employed in a system for automated swallowing assessment and diagnosis of swallowing disorders (dysphagia) by acoustical means. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A novel method is proposed to characterize the AF based on structure and the quantification of the recurrence plot (RP) to predict the termination of the AF. The RP of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is firstly obtained and eleven features are extracted to characterize its three basic patterns. Then the sequential forward search (SFS) algorithm and Davies-Bouldin criterion are utilized to select the feature subset which can predict the AF termination effectively. Finally, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network is applied to predict the AF termination. An AF database which includes one training set and two testing sets (A and B) of Holter ECG recordings is studied. Experiment results show that 97{\%} of testing set A and 95{\%} of testing set B are correctly classified. It demonstrates that this algorithm has the ability to predict the spontaneous termination of the AF effectively. {\textcopyright} 2008 IPEM.},

Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is a sensitive tool for assessment of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction.

The aim of the study was to detect heart rate dysregulation in DM by RP and to ascertain which of the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) measures are changed in patients with DM compared to control group. We analysed HRV recordings from 17 young patients with type 1 DM and 17 healthy matched control subjects. RQA was performed on RPs with a fixed value of recurrence points percentage. From RQA measures based on diagonal lines, we have found higher percentage of determinism in DM group (P=0.038). Trapping time measure was also higher in DM (P=0.022). RQA revealed changes in dynamics recurrences with reduced complexity of heart rate control in young diabetic patients. As RQA parameters are independent of overall HRV, parameters of RP should be used together with linear HRV parameters for better description of heart rate dysregulation in patients with diabetics.},

abstract = {During the last years, the concept of recurrence plots has received considerable interest as a tool for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary time series. However, in the case of discrete-valued observables or variations on very different time scales, problems may occur in direct interpretations of the results of recurrence quanti. cation analysis (RQA). As a potential solution, we suggest combining this approach with ideas from symbolic time series analysis, which allows an arbitrary static or dynamic coarse-graining of the dynamics that goes beyond recent recurrence plot based methods. As an illustrative application, we discuss how the resulting symbolic recurrence plots may be used for a quantitative investigation of the dynamics of discrete-valued inventory levels of cooperating firms in a manufacturing network. Based on discrete-event simulations, measures from traditional RQA are used to evaluate the performance of the individual firms under different production strategies as well as order policies. The results of our investigations are an important step towards an anticipative knowledge about the performance of manufacturing systems under different conditions, which is of major importance for the planning and control of both production and logistics.},

We assume that the change parameters are unknown and the change could be either slight or drastic. The process of change detection is based on characteristic dynamical system invariants. Changes in the invariants' values of the dynamical systems are the indicators of change. We propose a method of change detection based on the fractal dimension and recurrence plot.

We describe a method for detecting a stimulus-related change in brain electrical activity that persists while the stimulus is present (presence effect). The method, which is based on phase-space embedding of the EEG time series followed by quantitative analysis of the recurrence plot of the embedded signal, was used to demonstrate the occurrence of a presence effect in separate groups of human subjects exposed to sound, a magnetic field, and light. Any form of law-governed dynamical activity induced in the EEG can be detected, particularly activity that is nonlinearly related to the stimulus.

The success of five commonly used schemes for estimating interplanetary propagation times is examined. Propagation assuming a fixed plane normal at 45 degrees to the GSE x-axis (i.e. the Parker Spiral estimate) is found to give optimal mutual information. The mutual information depends on the point in space chosen as the target for the propagation estimate, and we find that it is maximized by choosing a point in the nightside rather than dayside magnetosphere. In addition, we employ recurrence plot analysis to visualize contributions to the mutual information, this suggests that it appears on timescales of hours rather than minutes.},

There is an increasing demand to evaluate radiation effects on dielectric performance. This paper presents a recurrence plot (RP) approach to analyse surface discharge sequences of gamma-ray irradiated polymer materials based on tracking test. Studying the non-linear characteristics of discharge sequences can assist in understanding the underlying mechanism of the discharge process. Discharge sequences of the test are extended to m-dimensional phase space by using the phase space reconstructed method. As test samples, polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) and polybutylene naphthalate (PBN) were irradiated to 100 kGy and then up to 1 MGy with a dosage rate of 10 kGy h−1 by using a 60Co gamma source. The tracking tests were carried out according to the test method described in IEC60112. It is found that the RPs can give visual recurrent patterns of discharge sequences for identification of the effects of gamma-ray radiation dosage on the resistance to tracking of the polymers. The detection of recurrent patterns together with comparative tracking index value results indicate that with the increase in the radiation dosage, the resistance to tracking of PBT decreases, but increases for PBN.},

The aim of the study was to detect heart rate dysregulation in DM by RP and to ascertain which of the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) measures are changed in patients with DM compared to control group. We analysed HRV recordings from 17 young patients with type 1 DM and 17 healthy matched control subjects. RQA was performed on RPs with a fixed value of recurrence points percentage. From RQA measures based on diagonal lines, we have found higher percentage of determinism in DM group (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}038). Trapping time measure was also higher in DM (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}022). RQA revealed changes in dynamics recurrences with reduced complexity of heart rate control in young diabetic patients.

The sequences of three recurrence plot features of the reconstructed trajectories (which have shown discriminating capability between swallowing and breath sounds) were modeled by three hidden Markov models.

To get a quantitative measure of dynamical transition patterns of IP-network traffic, we used the values of determinism (DET) defined by the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Also, when evaluating the fractal-based properties of IP-network traffic, we focused on two parameters: (i) the long-range dependence (LRD)-related scaling parameter $\alpha$ derived from the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and (ii) the range of the generalized fractal dimension. In applying this method to traffic analysis, we performed two kinds of traffic measurement in Tokyo, Japan, and derived the values of DET and fractal-based parameters of IP-network traffic over time. In checking the measured network traffic, we found that the characteristic with respect to DET and self-similarity seen in the measured network traffic fluctuated over time, with different time-variation patterns for two measurement locations. Results also confirmed that a larger value of DET or accumulated DET reflected increases in the degree of LRD of IP-network traffic and that the accumulated DET reflected the decreases in the degree of multi-fractality of IP-network traffic. As a result, we confirmed that RP-based measures can be effective for evaluating the non-stationary transition patterns of IP-network traffic in terms of quantitative fractal-based properties. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Irradiation effects on tracking resistance of polymer insulation materials should be investigated due to the increasing usage in radiation-prone environments. This paper presents a study on dc tracking resistance of gamma-ray irradiated polycarbonate mixed with polyethylene by use of IEC 60112 method. The samples were irradiated in air up to 100 kGy and 1000 kGy with a dosage rate of 10 kGy/h using a 60Co gamma source. Because the data of tracking resistance obtained from the tracking test has a wide variation, discharge current in the test is considered as a main factor to estimate the tracking resistance. A recurrence plot analysis of discharge current has been made to evaluate the tracking resistance more consistently. Obtained results showed that after gamma-ray irradiation, the tracking resistance was improved compared with that of the unirradiated sample. The tracking resistance showed an increasing tendency from 0 kGy to 100 kGy but a decreasing tendency from 100 kGy to 1000 kGy. There was a threshold value for the tracking resistance around 100 kGy, which was related to the reaction of cross-linking and degradation. The topological structures of the recurrence plots with the irradiated samples were different from that of the unirradiated one. There were bigger white space segments, which indicated that there were high amplitude transients in the discharge currents of unirradiated sample. The recurrence point density increased from 100 kGy to 1000 kGy, which suggested that the discharge process of the total dose at 1000 kGy was more intensive than that at 100 kGy. The irradiation effects on the tracking resistance can be visually identified by the recurrence plot.},

Gathered data is analyzed to get insight about behavior of users and then to detect traits of users. Currently many different methods are used to analyze data and there is still no one best method for analyzing different parameters of computer systems. We use non-linear methods to analyze gathered data because we assume that computer system is the non-linear one because of inter-program dependencies in current multi-program, multi-user operating systems. To best describe behavior of entire system we choose number of interrupts per second as analyzed variable because this value shows overall state of activity of programs being run on the system. We show that using recurrence plot can show some similarities in behavior of system, and therefore can be used to detect similarities and differences in users behavior.},

abstract = {Breathing patterns are characteristically different between active and quiet sleep states in infants. It has been previously identified that breathing dynamics are governed by a non-linear controller which implies the need for a nonlinear analytical tool. Further, it has been shown that quantified nonlinear variables are different between adult sleep states. This study aims to determine whether a nonlinear analytical tool known as recurrence plot analysis can characterize breath intervals of active and quiet sleep states in infants. Overnight polysomnograms were obtained from 32 healthy infants. The 6 longest periods each of active and quiet sleep were identified and a software routine extracted inter-breath interval data for recurrence plot analysis. Determinism (DET), laminarity (LAM) and radius (RAD) values were calculated for an embedding dimension of 4, 6, 8 and 16, and fixed recurrence of 0.5, 1, 2, 3.5 and 5{\%}. Recurrence plots exhibited characteristically different patterns for active and quiet sleep. Active sleep periods typically had higher values of RAD, DET and LAM than for quiet sleep, and this trend was invariant to a specific choice of embedding dimension or fixed recurrence. These differences may provide a basis for automated sleep state classification, and the quantitative investigation of pathological breathing patterns.},

The quantification errors in the discrete RR time series produce considerable errors in the ApEn estimation (bias and variance) when the signal variability or the sampling frequency is low. Similar errors can be found in indices related to the quantification of recurrence plots. An easy way to calculate a figure of merit [the signal to resolution of the neighborhood ratio (SRN)] is proposed in order to predict when the bias in the indices could be high. When SRN is close to an integer value n, the bias is higher than when near n - 1/2 or n + 1/2. Moreover, if SRN is close to an integer value, the lower this value, the greater the bias is.},

HRV complexity was reduced along with the HRV magnitude after changing from the supine to the standing position. In contrast, the BPV magnitude increased and BPV complexity decreased upon standing.

The objective of this paper is to illustrate how the MRP-RQA (multivariate recurrence plot-recurrence quantification analysis) approach may serve to characterize ecosystems driven by both deterministic and stochastic forces. The strength of the MRP-RQA approach resides in its independence from constraining assumptions regarding outliers, noise, stationarity and transients. Its utility is demonstrated by means of two spatiotemporal series (summer and spring datasets) of light intensity variations in an old growth forest ecosystem. Results revealed qualitative differences in homogeneity, transiency, and drift typologies between the MRPs derived from each dataset. RQA estimates of determinism and Kolmogorov entropy supported the idea that mixed chaotic-stochastic dynamics may be common in mesoscale forest habitats. Advantages and inconveniences of the MRP-RQA approach are also discussed in the more general context of monitoring ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, traditional classification approaches for traffic to higher-level application mapping, such as those based on port or payload analysis, are highly inaccurate for many emerging applications and hence useless in actual networks. This paper presents a recurrence plot-based traffic classification approach based on the analysis of non-stationary "hidden" transition patterns of IP traffic flows. Such nonlinear properties cannot be affected by payload encryption or dynamic port change and hence cannot be easily masqueraded. In performing a quantitative assessment of the above transition patterns, we used recurrence quantification analysis, a nonlinear technique widely used in many fields of science to discover the time correlations and the hidden dynamics of statistical time series. Our model proved to be effective for providing a deterministic interpretation of recurrence patterns derived by complex protocol dynamics in end-to-end traffic flows, and hence for developing qualitative and quantitative observations that can be reliably used in traffic classification. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The idea is that seizure represents transitions of an epileptic brain from its normal (chaotic) state to an abnormal (more ordered) state. Some nonlinear measures including correlation dimension, maximum Lyapunov exponent and wavelet entropy and a graphical tool, named recurrence plot, as well as a novel technique that collects some statistics of the state space organization were used to characterize interictal, preictal and ictal states and derivate a phase transition. The novelty of this work includes of introducing new types of indicators base upon some nonlinear features besides of proposing a new feature of point distribution in phase space. Our results show that (1) these three states are separable in 3-D feature space of nonlinear measures with a gradual decrease of their quantity in seizure evolution, (2) strong rhythmicity, which manifests in recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis measures, appears in dynamic while having entered into seizure and (3) different volumes of state space are occupied during each phase of epileptic disorder. The significance of the work is that this information is a step into the detection of a preictal state and consequently is helpful in the prediction and control of epileptic seizures. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

For predictability, the characteristics of the hourly accepted Weighted Average Price (WAP) as the topmost price index of this market is analyzed. The analysis tools are time series analysis methods such as power spectral density analysis, phase space reconstruction and test of surrogates, the fractional dimension and the slope of integral sums and the recurrence plots. The results indicate a deterministic, un-stationary and seasonal behavior in addition to unstable periodic orbits and even chaotic behavior in WAP time series. These observations imply just short-term predictability of WAP behavior. The interactive behavior of WAP with the hourly required load (RL) is also considered.

There is a high level of phase synchronization between SNs and SAs, but the phase synchronization is detected only in their low-frequency components, corresponding to time scales of about 7 to 12 years. Their high-frequency components show a noisy behavior with strong phase mixing. Coherent phase variables should exist only for a frequency band with periodicities around the dominating 11-year cycle for SNs and SAs. There are some small phase differences between them.

Both the cross-wavelet transform and wavelet coherence analyses show an asynchronous behavior with phase mixing in the high-frequency components of hemispheric sunspot activity and a strong synchronous behavior with coherent phase angles in the low-frequency components corresponding to period scales around the Schwabe cycle. Although a phase coherence is found at timescales of about 8.5-13.5 yr (which is similar to those of Donner {\&} Thiel, but within a shorter period), phases are not always coherent at the timescales in the considered time interval. The availability of a physical, meaningful phase definition depends crucially on the appropriate choice of reference frequencies. At the coherent period scales, the leading role is found from those conditions where processes of sunspot formation in the northern hemisphere occur earlier than in the southern one (except some exceptions in several years around the year 1900) during the years of about 1874-1926 to those where the opposite is true during the years of about 1926-1966, and returning back again during the years of about 1966-2008. The mean phase synchronization values at the coherent timescales given by wavelet coherence represent the running trend of the line of synchronization given by a cross-recurrence plot.},

abstract = {This work presents the assessment of the dynamics of electrochemical corrosion of aluminium through Michelson's optical interferometry measurements. Data were analysed using a new analysis method named Recurrence Plots (RP). This method allows the assessment of the dynamics of the pitting corrosion process of aluminium in chloride solution. After electrochemical potentiodynamic polarization, the curve characterizing the system corrosion regions was obtained. Interferograms for different regions (potentials) under potentiostatic control were registered, and digitally transformed. The analysis of these optical variable-series were conducted using a recurrence plot (RP) and quantification analysis (RQA). From the analysis it was determined the percent recurrence ({\%}R), the percent determinism ({\%}D) and the information Entropy for different electrochemical potentials. These parameters increased with polarization potential defining the different corrosion conditions of the metal from the active, passive pre-pitting and pitting regions within the polarization curve. From the interferometric measurements and RP analysis, it was possible to identify the different corrosion conditions and establish that pitting corrosion induced a more deterministic dynamics on the electrochemical process. {\textcopyright}The Electrochemical Society.},

The quantification errors in the discrete RR time series produce considerable errors in the ApEn estimation (bias and variance) when the signal variability or the sampling frequency is low. Similar errors can be found in indices related to the quantification of recurrence plots. An easy way to calculate a figure of merit [the signal to resolution of the neighborhood ratio (SRN)] is proposed in order to predict when the bias in the indices could be high. When SRN is close to an integer value n, the bias is higher than when near n - 1/2 or n + 1/2. Moreover, if SRN is close to an integer value, the lower this value, the greater the bias is.},

RP and RQA are good at working with non-stationarity and noisy data, in detecting changes in data behavior, in particular in detecting breaks, like a phase transition and in informing about other dynamic properties of a time series. Endogenous Stock Market Crashes have been modeled as phase changes in recent times. Motivated by this, we have used RP and RQA techniques for detecting critical regimes preceding an endogenous crash seen as a phase transition and hence give an estimation of the initial bubble time. We have used a new method for computing RQA measures with confidence intervals. We have also used the techniques on a known exogenous crash to see if the RP reveals a different story or not. The analysis is made on Nifty, Hong Kong AOI and Dow Jones Industrial Average, taken over a time span of about 3 years for the endogenous crashes. Then the RPs of all time series have been observed, compared and discussed. All the time series have been first transformed into the classical momentum divided by the maximum Xmax of the time series over the time window which is considered in the specific analysis. RPs have been plotted for each time series, and RQA variables have been computed on different epochs. Our studies reveal that, in the case of an endogenous crash, we have been able to identify the bubble, while in the case of exogenous crashes the plots do not show any such pattern, thus helping us in identifying such crashes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

When a threshold classifier was trained, the RQA variable recurrence was able to correctly classify 94.3{\%} of periods in a test dataset.

METHODS A parameter describing the average length of vertical line structures in recurrence plots is calculated at a time resolution of 1 s as 'instantaneous trapping time'. Threshold comparison of this parameter is used to detect ongoing CSA. In data from 26 patients (duration 208 h) we assessed sensitivity for detection of CSA and mixed apnea (MSA) events by comparing the results obtained from 8-channel Holter ECGs to the annotations (860 CSA, 480 MSA) of simultaneously registered polysomnograms. RESULTS Multivariate combination of the EDR from different ECG leads improved the detection accuracy significantly. When all eight leads were considered, an average instantaneous vertical line length above 5 correctly identified 1126 of the 1340 events (sensitivity 84{\%}) with a total number of 1881 positive detections. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that recurrence plot analysis is a promising tool for detection and delineation of CSA epochs from EDR signals with high time resolution. Moreover, the approach is likewise applicable to directly measured respiratory signals.},

abstract = {As computers are getting faster and disks are growing bigger more data describing user behaviour can be gathered. These data can be analysed to gain insight into user behaviour and then to detect user traits. Currently many different methods are used to analyse data — and there is still no one best method for analysing different parameters of computer systems. Computer systems behave non-linearly because they run many programs on multi-user operating systems; this causes inter-program dependencies requiring non- linear methods to analyse gathered data. The aim of the article is to present how non-linear methods are able to detect subtle changes introduced into system by user's actions. Number of interrupts per second was chosen as variable describing system's behaviour. Analysis presented in this article focuses on idle system and system busy accessing hardware. Article shows that using recurrence plot can reveal similarities in behaviour of the system running different programs, and therefore can be used to detect similarities and differences in users behaviour. This article presents analysis of system activity through usage of series of recurrence plots to detect changes introduced by user actions. Analysis of lengths of horizontal and vertical lines on recurrence plots allows for describing periodicity of the system. This allows for gaining insight into behaviour of entire computing environment. Article shows that different tasks (such as network transmission, writing or reading from CD-ROM, compressing data) result in different recurrence plots; at the same time changes introduced by those tasks are hard to detect without analysis data. This means that usage of recurrence plot is crucial in detecting changes introduced in system by user's actions. Keywords:},

At first we devised a multistep algorithm, able to capture TSEP from EEG during sleep in 10 healthy volunteers. The time series of TSEP were then analyzed according to the Recurrence Plot (RP). TSEP series showed to form a pseudo-periodic series which becomes progressively denser and more stable until steady slow wave NREM sleep is reached, but looses stability just before REM sleep starts. This suggests that deterministic oscillatory patterns maybe adequate descriptors of the balance between homeostatic needs for NREM sleep and REM sleep pressure, supported by different cortical neuronal populations interactions.},

abstract = {Using the high-speed camera the time sequences of the classical flow patterns of horizontal gas-liquid pipe flow are recorded, from which the average gray-scale values of single-frame images are extracted. Thus obtained gray-scale time series is decomposed by the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method, the various scales of the signals are processed by Hurst exponent method, and then the dual-fractal characteristics are obtained. The scattered bubble and the bubble cluster theories are applied to the evolution analysis of two-phase flow patterns. At the same time the various signals are checked in the chaotic recursion chart by which the two typical characteristics (diagonal average length and Shannon entropy) are obtained. Resulting term of these properties, the dynamic characteristics of gas-liquid two-phase flow patterns are quantitatively analyzed. The results show that the evolution paths of gas-liquid two-phase flow patterns can be well characterized by the integrated analysis on the basis of the gray-scale time series of flowing images from EMD, Hurst exponents and Recurrence Plot (RP). In the middle frequency section (2nd, 3rd, 4th scales), three flow patterns decomposed by the EMD exhibit dual fractal characteristics which represent the dynamic features of bubble cluster, single bubble, slug bubble and scattered bubble. According to the change of diagonal average lengths and recursive Shannon entropy characteristic value, the structure deterministic of the slug flow is better than the other two patterns. After the decomposition by EMD the slug flow and the mist flow in the high frequency section have obvious peaks. Anyway, it is an effective way to understand and characterize the dynamic characteristics of two-phase flow patterns using the multi-scale non-linear analysis method based on image gray-scale fluctuation signals. {\textcopyright} 2010 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).},

The linear analysis might not provide the enough useful information for the wrist pulse signals any more, so it is proposed the combination of wavelet packet and recurrence quantification plot analysis to analyze the wrist pulses in this paper. In this paper, 5 kinds of wrist pulse signals, which are the slippery pulses, the normal pulses, the thread pulses, the taut pulses and the slippery and taut pulses, are analyzed by using the recurrence quantification analysis which based on wavelet packets transform, and some results are obtained finally. From recurrence plot and recurrence quantification plot analysis based on wavelet packets transform, the differences can be observed among those 5 kinds of wrist pulses, which mean that the recurrence quantification plot analysis measures are the useful features to distinguish different kinds of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) wrist pulses for the further classification.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study examines the suitability of recurrence plot analysis for the problem of central sleep apnea (CSA) detection and delineation from ECG-derived respiratory (EDR) signals. METHODS: A parameter describing the average length of vertical line structures in recurrence plots is calculated at a time resolution of 1 s as 'instantaneous trapping time'. Threshold comparison of this parameter is used to detect ongoing CSA. In data from 26 patients (duration 208 h) we assessed sensitivity for detection of CSA and mixed apnea (MSA) events by comparing the results obtained from 8-channel Holter ECGs to the annotations (860 CSA, 480 MSA) of simultaneously registered polysomnograms. RESULTS: Multivariate combination of the EDR from different ECG leads improved the detection accuracy significantly. When all eight leads were considered, an average instantaneous vertical line length above 5 correctly identified 1126 of the 1340 events (sensitivity 84{\%}) with a total number of 1881 positive detections. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that recurrence plot analysis is a promising tool for detection and delineation of CSA epochs from EDR signals with high time resolution. Moreover, the approach is likewise applicable to directly measured respiratory signals.},

Further more, the prediction methods BPNN (back propagation neural network) and K-NN (nearest neighbor) were employed to predict the short-term traffic flows with different periodicity. The result of an empirical study indicates that the traffic flow time series periodicity differs with the length of statistical time interval and the time period in a day. The traffic flow time series with a statistical time interval of 5 min show a good real-time performance and a strong periodicity. The periodicity has a positive correlation with the prediction accuracy of short-term traffic flow: The traffic flow in night time has a weak periodicity for which the prediction accuracy is 87.41{\%}, while the traffic flow in day time has a strong periodicity for which the prediction accuracy is 92.16{\%}.},

abstract = {Substantial clinical overlap may exist amongst functional somatic syndromes, in general, and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM), in particular. The underlying pathophysiology of these disorders is unclear. In this article we review studies performed at our institution, exploring similarities and dissimilarities between CFS and FM based on autonomic nervous functioning and electrocardiographic QT. Two methods were recently developed to assess autonomic nervous functioning via cardiovascular reactivity in response to a standardized postural challenge. The 'hemodynamic instability score' (HIS) computes blood pressure and heart rate changes along the tilt test and the resulting measurements are processed by image analysis techniques. Three studies assessed the HIS in CFS patients. Group averages of HIS were CFS = +3.72 (SD 5.02) vs. healthy = -4.62 (SD 2.26) and FM -3.25 (SD 2.63) (p  {\textless} 0.0001). An other technique is based on beat-to-beat heart rate and pulse transit time recordings during the tilt test, data processing by fractal and recurrence plot analysis and computing a 'Fractal  {\&}  Recurrence Analysis-based Score' (FRAS). FRAS values  {\textgreater} 0.22 were specific for CFS vs. healthy subjects and FM (2 studies). A different approach, measurement of the QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram found that the corrected QT in CFS patients is relatively shortened and thereby differs from QT in FM (p  {\textless} 0.0001). Jointly, these records show characteristic features to the CFS dysautonomia phenotype, supporting the distinction between CFS and FM. This data may be relevant in providing objective criteria for CFS diagnosis and distinction from other functional somatic syndromes. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract = {Recent studies in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously  hypertensive (SHR) rats show that some nonlinear indexes derived from the  recurrence plot method may be better markers of sympathetic activity than  the spectral powers of blood pressure (BP). We herein investigated the  relationships between nonlinear indexes and plasma noradrenaline  concentration in conscious WKY rats and SHRs. Blood pressure was recorded  for 30 min after intravenous injection of saline (0.9{\%} NaCl, 100  microL/kg), hexamethonium (20 mg/kg), atropine (0.5 mg/kg), atenolol (1  mg/kg) or prazosin (1 mg/kg). Spectral power in the low-frequency (LF)  band and the nonlinear index (L(max)), calculated on diastolic (DBP) and  systolic blood pressures (SBP), were used to analyse the BP signal.  Noradrenaline concentration was determined by radioenzymatic technique. A  robust stepwise regression analysis - using noradrenaline concentration as  dependent variable, and LF, L(max) and treatment, as independent variables  -shows that treatment is the main variable explaining the variance of  noradrenaline level in WKY rats, excluding the use of the pooled data to  explore the relationship between noradrenaline concentration and LF or  L(max). In contrast, in SHRs, treatment has no effect on the variance of  noradrenaline concentration and the pooled data were then used. In this  group, no correlation was observed between noradrenaline concentration and  LF. In contrast, very high positive correlation was observed between  noradrenaline level and L(max)-DBP (r = 0.59; P = 0.0005) or L(max)-SBP (r  = 0.53; P {\textless} 0.002). The results strengthen our previous suggestion that  nonlinear indexes may be better tools than spectral powers to investigate  the sympathetic nervous system.},

abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and increases the risk of stroke. Predicting the onset of paroxysmal AF (PAF), based on noninvasive techniques, is clinically important and can be invaluable in order to avoid useless therapeutic intervention and to minimize risks for the patients. In this paper, we propose an effective PAF predictor which is based on the analysis of the RR-interval signal. This method consists of three steps: preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. In the first step, the QRS complexes are detected from the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and then the RR-interval signal is extracted. In the next step, the recurrence plot (RP) of the RR-interval signal is obtained and five statistically significant features are extracted to characterize the basic patterns of the RP. These features consist of the recurrence rate, length of longest diagonal segments (L(max )), average length of the diagonal lines (L(mean)), entropy, and trapping time. Recurrence quantification analysis can reveal subtle aspects of dynamics not easily appreciated by other methods and exhibits characteristic patterns which are caused by the typical dynamical behavior. In the final step, a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier is used for PAF prediction. The performance of the proposed method in prediction of PAF episodes was evaluated using the Atrial Fibrillation Prediction Database (AFPDB) which consists of both 30 min ECG recordings that end just prior to the onset of PAF and segments at least 45 min distant from any PAF events. The obtained sensitivity, specificity, positive predictivity and negative predictivity were 97{\%}, 100{\%}, 100{\%}, and 96{\%}, respectively. The proposed methodology presents better results than other existing approaches.},

As it was initially developed for the study of dynamical systems, and was later used in nonlinear time series analysis, the question of using it as a signal processing tool has not been put into discussion yet. In this field the projective techniques are largely used, with good results. Nevertheless, they also have some limitations - especially regarding transient signal processing. But this kind of signals are ubiquitous in real world. In addition, propagation through various media as well as on multiple paths lead to delayed, attenuated and dilated versions of the original transients. In this paper we study the behaviour of the recurrence plot analysis method in the context of analyzing some finite duration signals being subject to rescalings of the amplitude and time axes. This study is a starting point in employing the analysis of recurrences in investigations of a large class of real world signals.},

It uses recurrence plot analysis to characterize patterns of repetition in the feature sequence, and the normalized compression distance, a practical approximation of the joint Kolmogorov complexity, to measure the pairwise similarity between the plots. By measuring the distance between intermediate representations of signal structure, the proposed method departs from common approaches to music structure analysis which assume a block-based model of music, and thus concentrate on segmenting and clustering sections. The approach ensures that global structure is consistently and robustly characterized in the presence of tempo, instrumentation, and key changes, while the used metric provides a simple to compute, versatile and robust alternative to common approaches in music similarity research. Finally, experimental results demonstrate success at characterizing similarity, while contributing an optimal parameterization of the proposed approach.},

METHODS: 42 students volunteered to participate to the study about HRV and stress. For each student, two recordings were performed: one during an on-going university examination, assumed as a real-life stressor, and one after holidays. Nonlinear analysis of HRV was performed by using Poincare Plot, Approximate Entropy, Correlation dimension, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, Recurrence Plot. For statistical comparison, we adopted the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test and for development of a classifier we adopted the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). RESULTS: Almost all HRV features measuring heart rate complexity were significantly decreased in the stress session. LDA generated a simple classifier based on the two Poincare Plot parameters and Approximate Entropy, which enables stress detection with a total classification accuracy, a sensitivity and a specificity rate of 90{\{}{\%}{\}}, 86{\{}{\%}{\}}, and 95{\{}{\%}{\}} respectively.

Because of the non-linear and dynamic nature of the EEG signals, it is difficult to effectively decipher the subtle changes in these signals by visual inspection and by using linear techniques. Therefore, non-linear methods are being researched to analyze the EEG signals. In this work, we use the recorded EEG signals in Recurrence Plots (RP), and extract Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) parameters from the RP in order to classify the EEG signals into normal, epileptic (ictal) and background (pre-ictal) classes. Recurrence Plot (RP) is a graph that shows all the times at which a state of the dynamical system recurs. In this work, we have used ten RQA parameters to quantify the important features in the EEG signals. These features were fed to seven different classifiers: Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Fuzzy Sugeno Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), Decision Tree (DT), and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). Our results show that the SVM and Fuzzy classifiers were able to identify the EEG class with an average efficiency of 94.4{\%}, sensitivity and specificity of 97.7{\%} and 94.7{\%}, respectively.},

Most research has been directed to either analytical and experimental studies of brake squeal mechanisms or the prediction of brake squeal propensity using finite element methods. By comparison, there is a lack of systematic analysis of brake squeal data obtained from a noise dynamometer. It is well known that brake squeal is a nonlinear transient phenomenon and a number of studies using analytical and experimental models of brake systems (e.g., pin-on-disc) indicate that it could be treated as a chaotic phenomenon. Data obtained from a full brake system on a noise dynamometer were examined with nonlinear analysis techniques. The application of recurrence plots reveals chaotic structures even in noisy data from the squealing events. By separating the time series into different regimes, lower dimensional attractors are isolated and quantified by dynamic invariants such as correlation dimension estimates or Lyapunov exponents. Further analysis of the recurrence plot of squealing events by means of recurrence quantification analysis measures reveals different regimes of laminar and random behaviour, periodicity and chaos-forming recurrent transitions. These results help to classify brake squeal mechanisms and to enhance understanding of friction-related noise phenomena. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Predicting the onset of PAF, based on non-invasive techniques, is clinically important and can be invaluable in order to avoid useless therapeutic interventions and to minimize the risks for the patients. This method consists of four steps: Preprocessing, feature extraction, feature reduction, and classification. In the first step, the QRS complexes are detected from the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and then the HRV signal is extracted. In the next step, the recurrence plot (RP) of HRV signal is obtained and six features are extracted to characterize the basic patterns of the RP. These features consist of length of longest diagonal segments, average length of the diagonal lines, entropy, trapping time, length of longest vertical line, and recurrence trend. In the third step, these features are reduced to three features by the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) technique. Using LDA not only reduces the number of the input features, but also increases the classification accuracy by selecting the most discriminating features. Finally, a support vector machine-based classifier is used to classify the HRV signals. The performance of the proposed method in prediction of PAF episodes was evaluated using the Atrial Fibrillation Prediction Database which consists of both 30-minutes ECG recordings end just prior to the onset of PAF and segments at least 45 min distant from any PAF events. The obtained sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictivity were 96.55{\%}, 100{\%}, and 100{\%}, respectively. },

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to evaluate rolling bearing defect severity based on Recurrence Plot (RP) entropy. As a quantitative measure, the RP entropy is calculated from the probability distribution of the diagonal line length in the recurrence plot, where such plot graphically depicts a system's dynamics and provides a global picture of the autocorrelation in a time series over all available time-scales, in the reconstructed phase space, to characterize changing dynamics of the system. The experimental results have indicated that, as the working condition of the bearing deteriorates due to the initiation and/or progression of the structural damages, the frequency information contained in the vibration signal becomes increasingly complex, leading to the increase of the RP entropy. Therefore, the RP entropy can serve as an effective parameter for defect severity evaluation of rolling bearings. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

From 13 ECG records in long-term ST-T database, 170 ischemic episodes were selected with the duration of 34 s to 23 min 18 s, and two 5-min episodes immediately before and after each ischemic episode as non-ischemic ones for comparison. QT interval (QTI) and RR interval (RRI) were extracted and the ectopic beats were removed. Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) was performed on QTI and RRI series, respectively, and cross recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) on paired normalized QTI and RRI series. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical analysis. Results revealed that the RQA indexes for QTI and HRI series had the same changing trend during ischemia with more significantly changed indexes in QTI series. In the CRQA, indexes related to the vertical and horizontal structures in recurrence plot significantly increased, representing decreased dependency of QTI on RRI. Both QTI and RRI series showed reduced complexity during ischemia with higher sensitivity in ventricular repolarization. The weakened coupling between QTI and RRI suggests the decreased influence of sinoatrial node on QTI modulation during ischemia.},

Phase synchronization of cardiorespiratory coupling is often studied by a synchrogram analysis, a graphical tool investigating the relationship between instantaneous phases of two signals. Although several techniques have been proposed to automatically quantify the synchrogram, most of them require a preselection of a phase-locking ratio by trial and error. One technique does not require this information; however, it is based on the power spectrum of phase's distribution in the synchrogram, which is vulnerable to noise. This study aims to introduce a new technique to automatically quantify the synchrogram by studying its dynamic structure. Our technique exploits recurrence plot analysis, which is a well-established tool for characterizing recurring patterns and nonstationarities in experiments. We applied our technique to detect synchronization in simulated and measured infants' cardiorespiratory data. Our results suggest that the proposed technique is able to systematically detect synchronization in noisy and chaotic data without preselecting the phase-locking ratio. By embedding phase information of the synchrogram into phase space, the phase-locking ratio is automatically unveiled as the number of attractors.},

These patterns showed that the fluidized bed system has three different hydrodynamic behaviors as superficial gas velocity increases; at low gas velocities, macro structures become more dominant, further increase in gas velocity empowers influence of finer structures on the hydrodynamic and finally the fluidization regime changes. Additionally, these results were confirmed by recurrence rate (RR) and average cycle frequency.

Recurrence plots are an information visualization technique that can reveal trends and features in complex time series data. The recurrence plot technique works by measuring the similarity of points in a time series to all other points in the same time series and plotting the results in two dimensions. Previous studies have applied recurrence plotting techniques to textual data; however, these approaches plot recurrence using term-based similarity rather than conceptual similarity of the text. We introduce conceptual recurrence plots, which use a model of language to measure similarity between pairs of text utterances, and the similarity of all utterances is measured and displayed. In this paper, we explore how the descriptive power of the recurrence plotting technique can be used to discover patterns of interaction across a series of conversation transcripts.

This same method of application should prove useful in Systems Engineering as well. Recurrence Plots reveal long-term and emergent behavior in complex systems when specific criteria are met. This technique may be used in Systems Engineering in such diverse areas as Systems Architecture to predict emergent behaviors in Complex Systems and Program Management to predict the long-term health of a complex project among others.

Analysis of cardiac health using heart rate variation (HRV) has become a popular method to assess the activities of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). It is beneficial in the assessment of cardiac abnormalities, because of its ability to capture fast fluctuations that may be an indication of sympathetic and vagal activity. This paper documents work on the analysis of both normal and diabetic heart rate signals using time domain, frequency domain and nonlinear techniques. The study is based on data from 15 patients with diabetes and 15 healthy volunteers. Our results show that non-linear analysis of HRV is superior compared to time and frequency methods. Non-linear parameters namely,correlation dimension (CD), approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn) and recurrence plot properties (REC and DET), are clinically significant. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The feature extraction stage is one of the main tasks underlying pattern recognition, and, is particularly important for designing Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), i.e. structures capable of mapping brain signals in commands for external devices. Within one of the most used BCIs paradigms, that based on Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), such task is classically performed in the spectral domain, albeit it does not necessarily provide the best achievable performance. The aim of this work is to use recurrence-based measures in an attempt to improve the classification performance obtained with a classical spectral approaches for a fivecommand SSVEP-BCI system. For both recurrence and spectral spaces, features were selected using a cluster measure defined by the Davies-Bouldin index and the classification stage was based on linear discriminant analysis. As the main result, it was found that the threshold $\epsilon$ of the recurrence plot, chosen so as to yield a recurrence rate of 2.5{\%}, defined the key discriminant feature, typically providing a mean classification error of less than 2{\%} when information from 4 electrodes was used. Such classification performancewas significantly better than that attained using spectral features, which strongly indicates that RQA is an efficient feature extraction technique for BCI.},

Dynamics of the mechanical structure is studied analytically around the principal parametric resonance region, numerically and experimentally for a wide range of parameters. The influence of damping, nonlinear stiffness (hard and soft), amplitude and frequency of excitation on the system's behaviour is analysed in details. The obtained results show that the pendulum can be applied as a dynamical absorber. However, for selected parameters, near the main parametric resonance, instability, which transits the pendulum to chaotic oscillations or to a full rotation, occurs. Therefore, the application of a magnetorheological (MR) damper and a nonlinear spring is proposed to improve the dynamics and to control the response online. Periodic vibrations, chaotic motions or a full rotation of the pendulum obtained numerically are confirmed by the experiment. The chaotic nature of motion is determined from real signals by the attractor reconstruction and the recurrence plot calculation. The results show that the semi-active suspension may reduce dangerous motion and it also allows to maintain the pendulum at a given attractor or to jump to another one.},

A linear autoregressive moving average (ARMA) can only pull out the linear deterministic (LD) component of EAF reactive power time series. For the prediction to be made through both nonlinear deterministic (ND) and LD components, employing nonlinear models is necessary. However, before developing the nonlinear models for prediction, the necessity of the employing them should be verified by investigating the significance of the ND components in the process. This paper presents a novel approach for wide analysis of nonlinear behavior of EAFs reactive power time series related to eight ac EAFs installed in Mobarakeh steel industry, Isfahan, Iran to answer the question about the importance of their ND components. In the approach, a suitable linear auto regressive moving average (ARMA) model with order (4,4) is used for the time series to extract the residual time series. Then, a number of well established nonlinear analysis techniques such as time delay reconstruction, surrogate data, delay vector variance and recurrence plot methods are applied to the original and residual time series. To describe the nonlinear characteristics of the time series, some new indices are defined.

Detection of PD poses many problems in terms of speed of calculation and selection criteria, due to the nature of PD spectrum (frequency varying from a few hundreds of kilohertz up to hundreds of megahertz) and multitude of causes which lead to the occurrence of PD. These challenges take a great toll on the computing capability of today's PD detection systems. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we have developed an algorithm which uses the spectrogram to perform a fast detection of parts from the signal which are susceptible of partial discharge (PD) activity. The second stage calculates for each zone a detection curve using the HOS concept of bispectrum and RPA.

Recurrence is a fundamental property of many dynamical systems, which can be explored in phase spaces constructed from observational time series. A visualization tool of recurrence analysis called recurrence plot (RP) has been proved to be highly effective to detect transitions in the dynamics of the system. However, it was found that delay embedding can produce spurious structures in RPs. Network-based concepts have been applied for the analysis of nonlinear time series recently. We demonstrate that time series with different types of dynamics exhibit distinct global clustering coefficients and distributions of local clustering coefficients and that the global clustering coefficient is robust to the embedding parameters. We applied the approach to study skin blood flow oscillations (BFO) response to loading pressure. The results showed that global clustering coefficients of BFO significantly decreased in response to loading pressure (p{\textless}0.01). Moreover, surrogate tests indicated that such a decrease was associated with a loss of nonlinearity of BFO. Our results suggest that the recurrence network approach can practically quantify the nonlinear dynamics of BFO.},

abstract = {A mechanical system consisting of a blade prestressed on a rotating disc is considered. Such system forms a tribometer developed in order to accurately determine the surface state of fibrous materials. The surface to be analyzed is fixed on the disc, and the blade, on which is fixed strain gages, is the sensor. Until now a Fourier analysis, performed on the friction-induced vibration signal provided by the strain gages, allowed to deduct roughness-friction criteria. However, in addition to obscure the nonlinear part of the signal, Fourier analysis method requires acquisition of important data for a very long processing time. The present study was designed to assess the applicability of a nonlinear mathematical tool, recurrence plot and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), in addressing the problem of fibrous surface analysis and overcome the drawbacks of the Fourier analysis. The results show that these tools are able to replace the Fourier analysis and make available additional parameters, owing to RQA, that enhance the understanding of physical phenomena of our particular problem.},

Detection of PD poses many problems in terms of speed of calculation, selection criteria and multitude of causes which lead to the occurrence of PD. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we have developed an algorithm which uses the spectrogram to perform a fast detection of parts from the signal which are susceptible of PD activity. The second stage calculates for each zone a detection curve using the HOSA concept of bispectrum and RPA.

abstract = {Introduction: Sleep is a dynamic process whose macrostructure may be considered the result of graduations of transient EEG activities defining the microstructure of sleep. Among EEG activities, peculiar transient synchronized EEG patterns (TSEP) are supposed to play a role in organization and stabilization of NREM sleep. Materials and methods: Sleep recordings from 10 healthy subjects (5 males, 5 females; mean age 28.5+/-4.8 years; normal BMI), after an adaptation night, underwent a fullnight polysomnography in the sleep laboratory. Rough data of all EEG signals were exported into a MATLAB program specifically written to detect TSEP onsets, and then verified by visual inspection. The time series of TSEP sequences were analysed according to the Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) and Recurrence Plot (RP), non-linear analysis techniques suitable to disclose deterministic patterns in complex and apparently chaotic behaviours. Results: RP and RQA evidence the presence of attractors of different strength towards stable sleep. TSEP form a deterministic pseudo-periodic series with an oscillating period which becomes progressively shorter and finally stabilizes its recurrence rate ('attractor') until steady slow wave sleep (SWS) is reached. Both several seconds before REM sleep onset and during the last sleep cycles of the night, the system becomes unstable and inter-TSEP intervals exhibit higher variability. Discussion: We conclude that this approach is a suitable method to describe and quantify the deterministic neurophysiological processes during the building up of NREM sleep, so that it may become a novel method to detect subtle or otherwise unrecognizable conditions of disturbed sleep.},

Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the frequency and patterns of AF electrogram morphology recurrence determined by a modified recurrence plot (RP) analysis will show differences based on region in this pilot study. Methods: AF electrograms ({\textgreater}16 s) recorded from documented left atrial (LA) and right atrial (RA) sites in 13 patients (10 male, 59(plus or minus)10 years old) prior to AF ablation were analyzed. A 100 ms window for each automatically detected activation was extracted and cross-correlated with every other activation in a 30-sec recording. The result was a set of NxN cross-correlation (CC) values, where N is the number of detected activations. These values were displayed in a two-dimensional RP. A recurrence index (RI), the percentage of the most common morphology, was also computed. A high RI likely indicates consistent activation directions at the site of bipolar electrogram recording. Results: Figure A is a RP example. The checker board pattern of alternating high and low CC values indicates periodic recurrences in morphologies (RI=70{\%} for this example). The mean RI for all sites and all patients was 38(plus or minus)25{\%}. The highest RI was found in the left superior LA in all 4 paroxysmal AF patients (85(plus or minus)18{\%}, see Figure B). For 9 persistent AF patients, the highest RI was found in the RA (91(plus or minus)10{\%}) in 5 patients and in the left superior LA (95(plus or minus)6{\%}) in 4 patients. The persistent AF patients had higher maximum RIs in the RA than the paroxysmal AF patients (87(plus or minus)16 vs. 51(plus or minus)15{\%}, p=0.01). Conclusion: Electrogram morphology with highest recurrence rates were most frequently found in the left superior LA, a common location for AF triggers. Further work is needed to determine whether high electrogram repeatability reflects AF driver activity and whether RPs could be used as part of an ablation strategy.},

The experimental results demonstrate the proposed nonlinear measures provide important supplemental information and they are essential to the good performance in multifeatures. It is also shown that FGMMs outperform commonly used approaches including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machine in terms of the recognition rate. The best performance with the recognition rate of 96.7{\%} is achieved by using FGMMs with the multifeature combining Willison Amplitude and Determinism.},

Results of experimental studies conducted on a spindle-bearing test bed have demonstrated that, as the working condition of the bearing deteriorates due to the initiation and/or progression of structural damages, the frequency information contained in the vibration signal becomes increasingly complex, leading to the increase of the RP entropy. As a result, RP entropy can serve as an effective indicator for defect severity assessment of rolling bearings.},

COP time series were analyzed using recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) in both anteroposterior and mediolateral (ML) directions. Classical stabilometric variables (path length and range) were also computed. The results showed that RQA outputs quantifying predictability of COP fluctuations and Shannon entropy of recurrence plot diagonal line length distribution, were significantly higher in fallers, only for ML direction. In addition, the range of ML COP signals was also significantly higher in fallers. This result is in accordance with some findings of the literature and could be interpreted as an increased hip strategy in fallers. The RQA results seem coherent with the theory of loss of complexity with aging and disease.

This technique uses digital signal processing methods and, therefore, automates the detection of diabetes from ECG signals. In this paper, we describe the signal processing techniques that extract features from heart rate (HR) signals and present an analysis procedure that uses these features to diagnose diabetes.

We then developed a novel diabetic integrated index (DII) that is a combination of these nonlinear features. The DII indicates whether a particular HR signal was taken from a person with diabetes.

Subjective and objective testing results indicate that the proposed method has good quality compared with conventional blind bandwidth extension methods, and the performance of ITU-T G.722.1 codec with the proposed algorithm is better than that of G.722.1C codec at the same bit rate.},

abstract = {Correlation based Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) networks are instrumental in capturing the basic workings of a system and have been accepted for use in the analysis of stock and currency exchange markets. Research in network analysis of financial markets shows that although correlations underlying MST networks capture essential information, they do not faithfully capture dynamic behavior embedded in the time series data of financial systems. We present a new Phase Synchronization (PS) based method for establishing correlations between nonlinear time series data, prior to constructing the MST. In this method, time series data generated by each entity in a system is transformed to a recurrence plot and the recurrence plots are further transformed to trajectories in phase space. For each pair of trajectories, phase synchronization (PS) is quantified based on the degree of phase locking observed. Distances for the MST are then computed as a function of the PS between each entity pair. We demonstrate the method using Thailand Baht exchange rates with 82 countries from 2004 to 2012. We further analyze and compare networks constructed using the PS method (PS-MST) and the existing cross-correlation method (CC-MST), to study the differences in market dynamics captured by these methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {The multifractal analysis of binary images of DNA is studied in order to define a methodological approach to the classification of DNA sequences. This method is based on the computation of some multifractality parameters on a suitable binary image of DNA, which takes into account the nucleotide distribution. The binary image of DNA is obtained by a dot-plot (recurrence plot) of the indicator matrix. The fractal geometry of these images is characterized by fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, and succolarity. These parameters are compared with some other coefficients such as complexity and Shannon information entropy. It will be shown that the complexity parameters are more or less equivalent to FD, while the parameters of multifractality have different values in the sense that sequences with higher FD might have lower lacunarity and/or succolarity. In particular, the genome of Drosophila melanogaster has been considered by focusing on the chromosome 3r, which shows the highest fractality with a corresponding higher level of complexity. We will single out some results on the nucleotide distribution in 3r with respect to complexity and fractality. In particular, we will show that sequences with higher FD also have a higher frequency distribution of guanine, while low FD is characterized by the higher presence of adenine.},

Generally, the change of structural characteristics due to damage is analyzed by observing frequencies, mode shapes, damping, etc. However, the change of those modal features due to damage is minor, so that detecting the location of damage is difficult. Recently, an attractor-based monitoring system has been proposed. The recent study using chaotic excitation has demonstrated that the change of the attractor caused by damage is more sensitive than that of the most commonly used frequency and mode shape of the structure, in which the recurrence plot was applied successfully to the damage detection. However, damage localization has not been discussed sufficiently. An attempt in this study was made to develop a damage localization method using chaotic excitation and recurrence quantification analysis. It was demonstrated through experiment results that the proposed system makes it possible to detect damage locations.},

Preablation factors such as mean atrial fibrillation cycle length (AFCL) predict the likelihood of AF termination during ablation but recurring patterns and AFCL stability have not been evaluated. Objective To investigate novel predictors of acute and postoperative ablation outcomes from intracardiac electrograms: (1) recurring AFCL patterns and (2) localization index (LI) of the instantaneous fibrillatory rate distribution. Methods Sixty-two patients with AF (32 paroxysmal AF; 45 men; age 57 ± 10 years) referred for CA were enrolled. One-minute electrogram was recorded from coronary sinus (CS; 5 bipoles) and right atrial appendage (HRA; 2 bipoles). Atrial activations were detected automatically to derive the AFCL and instantaneous fibrillatory rate (inverse of AFCL) time series. Recurring AFCL patterns were quantified by using recurrence plot indices (RPIs): percentage determinism, entropy of determinism, and maximum diagonal length. AFCL stability was determined by using the LI. The CA outcome predictivity of individual indices was assessed. Results Patients with terminated atrial fibrillation (T-AF) had higher RPI (P {\textless}.05 in CS7-8) and LI than did those with nonterminated atrial fibrillation (P {\textless}.005 in CS3-4; P {\textless}.05 in CS5-6, CS7-8, and HRA). Patients free of arrhythmia after 3-month follow-up had higher RPI and LI (all P {\textless}.05 in CS7-8). All indices except percentage determinism predicted T-AF in CS7-8(area under the curve [AUC] ≥ 0.71; odds ratio [OR] ≥ 4.50; P {\textless}.05). The median AFCL and LI predicted T-AF in HRAD(AUC ≥ 0.75; OR ≥ 7.76; P {\textless}.05). The RPI and LI predicted 3-month follow-up in CS7-8(AUC ≥ 0.68; OR ≥ 4.17; P {\textless}.05). Conclusions AFCL recurrence and stability indices could be used in selecting patients more likely to benefit from CA. {\textcopyright} 2013 Heart Rhythm Society.},

abstract = {Breathing is a fundamental physiological process produced by movements generated and controlled by efferent signals from the nervous system. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms underlying breathing in humans is of particular interest. Another important practical issue is the design of noninvasive procedures for the diagnosis, prediction, and control of the respiratory system, which works as a subsystem embedded in the complex physiological environment of the human organism and its external environment. This paper provides a concise review of a selected set of modern techniques dedicated to the exploration of complex and varying systems and sets of time-series data. These methods are based on an 1D entropic tool (approximate and sample entropy, i.e., ApEn and SampEn, respectively), which is effective for assessing the regularity and complexity of information contained in data sets, as well as complex network theory, recurrence plot (RP) strategy, and the joint complex network-recurrence analysis mode. Exemplary results are given for real physiological data recorded in patients with symptoms of central sleep apnea syndrome. Although ApEn and SampEn are shown to be sensitive methods for the detection of pathological mechanisms affecting breathing patterns during sleep, qualitative and quantitative studies based on the RP strategy reveal even better efficiency for this task. In addition, the second mode of analysis enables multi-dimensional correlation of accessible data, which is important for studying the couplings between numerous physiological subsystems. Further work in this area is proposed to map the scheme of breathing physiology during sleep.},

The application of the most effective algorithm to the typical chaotic Lorenz system verifies the correctness of such an effective algorithm. It is verified that, based on the unthresholded RPs, one can reconstruct the original attractor by choosing different RP thresholds based on the Hirata algorithm. It is shown that, in real applications, it is possible to reconstruct the underlying dynamics by using quite little information from observations of real dynamical systems. Moreover, rules of the threshold chosen in the algorithm are also suggested.},

The height of dual-leg is 0.16m. The glass beads with diameters of 0.25-0.28mm were adopted as bed material. The results show that the RP could be utilized effectively to explain the nonlinear dynamic performance in the DL-FB and the chaos of the DL-FB is higher than that of the single distributor FB because of the combination of bubbling actions and solids exchange behavior between two half beds. With the increase of fluidization velocity, entropy as a recurrence quantification parameter varies along with a M-type curve at different fluidization velocities. Four processes were shown for the gas-solids flow in the DL-FB with the increase of the fluidization velocity lower fluidization velocity with no particles exchange, less solids exchange at lower fluidization velocity, solids exchange and particles dispersion. The trend of the effect of bed inventory on entropy is not obvious.},

Applying a quasi-one-dimensional chaotic return map technique, the topological differences between the mechanical and convective turbulences are explored. These quasi-one-dimensional return maps are produced using the local maxima of the first principal component of the reconstructed turbulence data. A comparison of the probability distribution of the local maxima of a forced Lorenz model with the turbulence data indicates the possible existence of a stable fixed point for both type of turbulences. Furthermore, dynamically the mechanical turbulence is found to resemble an unforced Lorenz model whereas the convective turbulence resembles a forced Lorenz model.},

abstract = {With the rapid technological advancement, network is almost everywhere in our daily life. Network theory leads to a new way to investigate the dynamics of complex systems. As a result, many methods are proposed to construct a network from nonlinear time series, including the partition of state space, visibility graph, nearest neighbors, and recurrence approaches. However, most previous works focus on deriving the adjacency matrix to represent the complex network and extract new network-theoretic measures. Although the adjacency matrix provides connectivity information of nodes and edges, the network geometry can take variable forms. The research objective of this article is to develop a self-organizing approach to derive the steady geometric structure of a network from the adjacency matrix. We simulate the recurrence network as a physical system by treating the edges as springs and the nodes as electrically charged particles. Then, force-directed algorithms are developed to automatically organize the network geometry by minimizing the system energy. Further, a set of experiments were designed to investigate important factors (i.e., dynamical systems, network construction methods, force-model parameter, nonhomogeneous distribution) affecting this self-organizing process. Interestingly, experimental results show that the self-organized geometry recovers the attractor of a dynamical system that produced the adjacency matrix. This research addresses a question, i.e., "what is the self-organizing geometry of a recurrence network?" and provides a new way to reproduce the attractor or time series from the recurrence plot. As a result, novel network-theoretic measures (e.g., average path length and proximity ratio) can be achieved based on actual node-to-node distances in the self-organized network topology. The paper brings the physical models into the recurrence analysis and discloses the spatial geometry of recurrence networks.},

abstract = {Moisture in oil-immersed transformer will become small bubbles suspending in insulation oil at high temperature. In order to investigate the influence of suspending bubbles on tracking failure of oil-impregnated pressboard in oil-paper insulation, a model based on needle-plate electrodes was established. This model was used to study effect of the number of suspending bubbles generated by dropped distilled water on the discharge voltage, how the discharge signals varied during the process of tracking failure on the oil-impregnated pressboard surface with the effect of suspending bubbles, and the surface carbonization process of oil-impregnated pressboard during tracking failure. The results show that when the number of suspending bubbles increases with the increase of dropped distilled water, the partial discharge inception voltage in oilpaper insulation descends slowly while the surface flashover inception voltage descends sharply. The discharge process can be divided into three periods orderly according to the discharge signals during tracking failure. The discharge signals in each period have some relationship with each other and the recurrence plot (RP) method is used to analyze characteristics of the discharge signals. The surface carbonization process can be also divided into three periods the same as the discharge process. The carbonization on the oil-pressboard surface is slow under partial discharge while it's fast under surface flashover. Because suspending bubbles make surface flashover much easier, so they make the tracking failure of the oil-impregnated pressboard much easier too, although the carbonization in the insulation oil is more difficult than that in the air. This paper is helpful to understand the process of tracking failure of oil-impregnated pressboard in insulation oil with the effect of suspending bubbles, which will be beneficial for the insulation protection in oil-immersed transformer. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Phase space reconstruction is a proper method to analysis this problem but there are two problems which block its usage in engineer project. One of them is how to determine the key parameters which will affect the result of phase space reconstruction. The other is how to express the reconstructed space. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to determine the parameters, delay time and embedded dimension, and introduce recurrence plot to describe the phase space. In specific, the new algorithm is a revised G-P algorithm by introducing B-spline method. Meanwhile we set another acceleration transducer to catch the background signal which is used to determine the threshold of drawing recurrence plot. These two changes will overcome the subjectivity of former algorithms of choosing parameters.

The signal even provides indicators which foreshadow impeding cardiac diseases, such as Preventricular Contraction (PVC). These indicators can be present at all times or they may occur at random. Without automated support, doctors have to spend lots of time studying and pinpointing abnormalities which indicate a heart condition. To assist in the diagnosis, we propose a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) which differentiates between HR signals from normal subjects and PVC patients. We have used the nonlinear method of Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to extract 12 features from Recurrence Plot (RPs). Out of these 12 features, only the eight most significant features were fed to three classifiers: Probabilistic Neural Network PNN, Decision Tree (DT), and {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-Nearest Neighbor ({\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-NN). With normal and PVC data from 142 patients, PNN and {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}/i{\textgreater}-NN achieved the best results. They obtained an average accuracy of 92.25{\%}, sensitivity and specificity of 73.33{\%} and 94.74{\%} respectively.

In the present paper, three advanced analysis approaches, including the rescaled range analysis, empirical mode decomposition and cross-recurrence plot, have been proposed to analyze the long-term persistence and secular trend of nonlinear and non-stationary time series. The case study uses the chaotic time-series data of solar-activity indicators in the time interval from 1874 May to 2013 March. The analysis results indicate that the combination of these three techniques is an effective tool not only for capturing the long-range persistence of non-stationary processes, but also for determining the secular trend of a complex time-series. {\&}copy; 2013 IEEE.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to create a methodology to characterize the dynamics of magnetic clouds (MCs) from signals measured by satellites in the interplanetary medium. We have tested spatio-temporal entropy (STE) technique to study 41 MCs identified by other authors, where the plasma sheath region has been identified. The STE was implemented in Visual Recurrence Analysis software to quantify the order in the recurrence plot. Some tests using synthetic time series were performed to validate the method. In particular, we worked with interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) components {\textless}em{\textgreater}B{\textless}/em{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}x{\textless}/em{\textgreater}{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, {\textless}em{\textgreater}B{\textless}/em{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}y{\textless}/em{\textgreater}{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, {\textless}em{\textgreater}B{\textless}/em{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}em{\textgreater}z{\textless}/em{\textgreater}{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of 16 s. Time windows from March 1998 to December 2003 for some MCs were selected. We found higher STE values in the sheaths and 0 STE values in some of the three components in most of the MCs (30 among 41 events). The trend is the principal cause of the lower STE values in the MCs. Also, MCs have magnetic field more structured than sheath and quiet solar wind. We have done a test considering the magnetic components of a cylindrically symmetric force-free field constructed analytically, with the result of 0 STE value. It agrees with the physical assumption of finding 0 STE values when studying experimental data in MC periods. The new feature just examined here adds to the usual features, as described in Burlaga et al. (1981), for the characterization of MCs. The STE calculation can be an auxiliary objective tool to identify flux ropes associated with MCs, mainly during events with no available plasma data but only with IMF.},

abstract = {Recurrence of states, in the meaning that states are arbitrary close after some time, is a fundamental property of deterministic dynamical systems and is typical of nonlinear or chaotic systems. The main idea of the recurrence plots (RPs) method consists in revealing all the times when the phase space trajectory of the dynamical system visits roughly the same area in the phase space. Such recurrence of states is marked within a two-dimensional matrix with ones and zeros. Graphical representation of such a matrix is known in the literature as a recurrence plot. The paper concerns results of research into dynamic properties and determinism of selected mechanical systems. In order to analyze measured responses (time histories) of the considered systems with the use of the recurrence plots, the phase space of these systems was reconstructed by delay embedding. The smallest sufficient embedding dimensions were estimated with the use of the false nearest neighbors algorithm. For the purposes of time delay determining the method of mutual information function was used. All the necessary computations were performed with the use of the CRP Toolbox for MATLAB.},

The non-stationarity patterns in the recurrence plots were studied. To fill up the deficiency of recurrence trend, which was the commonly used non-stationarity measurement in the recurrence plot and was not suitable for assessing non-stationarity of structural operational vibration signals, the variation of local recurrence density was discussed, the minimal local recurrence density was used as a reference, and then a new non-stationarity measurement named recurrence loss value was proposed in which the quality loss function theory was introduced. Some typical non-stationary signals were used to validate it. Comparison of recurrence trend and recurrence loss value was made, and the result illustrates their differences and similarities. For reinforcing proposed measurement, the measurements were used for operational vibration signals. The results show that recurrence loss value has a good applicability for operational vibration signals.},

Foraging efficiency of predator largely varies with the escaping ability of the prey from the predator. For this reason system experiences interesting and complex dynamical features with varying the strength of prey refuge, including both population extinction, predator extinction, stable coexistence, multiple invariant closed orbit in different chaotic regions, onset of chaos suddenly and sudden disappearance of the chaotic dynamics. In particular, we observe that when the prey is in stable, oscillatory or even chaotic status, then the predator can tend to extinction. Also, system experiences Hopf-bifurcation and flip bifurcations. Numerical computation is also performed to validate and visualize different theoretical results. The computations of Lyapunov exponent, fractal dimension of the map, recurrence plot and power spectral density confirm the chaotic dynamical behaviors. The analysis and results in this paper are interesting both in mathematics and biology. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The field of vibration-based structural health monitoring involves extracting a feature which robustly quantifies damage-induced changes of the structural dynamics. Generally, the change of structural characteristics due to damage is analyzed by observing frequencies, mode shapes, damping, etc. However, the change of those modal features due to damage is minor, so that detecting the location of damage is difficult. Recently, an attractor-based monitoring system has been proposed. The recent study using chaotic excitation has demonstrated that the change of the attractor caused by damage is more sensitive than that of the most commonly used frequency and mode shape of the structure, in which the recurrence plot was applied successfully to the damage detection. However, damage localization has not been discussed sufficiently. An attempt in this study was made to develop a damage localization method using chaotic excitation and recurrence quantification analysis. It was demonstrated through experiment results that the proposed system makes it possible to detect damage locations.},

abstract = {Breathing is a fundamental physiological process produced by movements generated and controlled by efferent signals from the nervous system. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms underlying breathing in humans is of particular interest. Another important practical issue is the design of noninvasive procedures for the diagnosis, prediction, and control of the respiratory system, which works as a subsystem embedded in the complex physiological environment of the human organism and its external environment. This paper provides a concise review of a selected set of modern techniques dedicated to the exploration of complex and varying systems and sets of time-series data. These methods are based on an 1D entropic tool (approximate and sample entropy, i.e., ApEn and SampEn, respectively), which is effective for assessing the regularity and complexity of information contained in data sets, as well as complex network theory, recurrence plot (RP) strategy, and the joint complex network-recurrence analysis mode. Exemplary results are given for real physiological data recorded in patients with symptoms of central sleep apnea syndrome. Although ApEn and SampEn are shown to be sensitive methods for the detection of pathological mechanisms affecting breathing patterns during sleep, qualitative and quantitative studies based on the RP strategy reveal even better efficiency for this task. In addition, the second mode of analysis enables multi-dimensional correlation of accessible data, which is important for studying the couplings between numerous physiological subsystems. Further work in this area is proposed to map the scheme of breathing physiology during sleep.},

abstract = {Heart Rate (HR) signals are important measures which can be used to assess the cardiac health of a patient. The signal even provides indicators which foreshadow impeding cardiac diseases, such as Preventricular Contraction (PVC). These indicators can be present at all times or they may occur at random. Without automated support, doctors have to spend lots of time studying and pinpointing abnormalities which indicate a heart condition. To assist in the diagnosis, we propose a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) which differentiates between HR signals from normal subjects and PVC patients. We have used the nonlinear method of Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to extract 12 features from Recurrence Plot (RPs). Out of these 12 features, only the eight most significant features were fed to three classifiers: Probabilistic Neural Network PNN, Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN). With normal and PVC data from 142 patients, PNN and K-NN achieved the best results. They obtained an average accuracy of 92.25{\%}, sensitivity and specificity of 73.33{\%} and 94.74{\%} respectively. Besides using classifiers, a novel Cardiac Health Index (CHI) was developed by using two nonlinear features: Maximal vertical line (Vmax) and Maximal diagonal line (Lmax). CHI can be used to indicate whether or not an Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal was taken from patient suffering from PVC. This index enhances the detection of PVC, thereby giving doctors more time to perform other crucial tasks. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Scientific Publishers.},

abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are difficult to interpret, and clinicians must undertake a long training process to learn to diagnose diabetes from subtle abnormalities in these signals. To facilitate these diagnoses, we have developed a technique based on the heart rate variability signal obtained from ECG signals. This technique uses digital signal processing methods and, therefore, automates the detection of diabetes from ECG signals. In this paper, we describe the signal processing techniques that extract features from heart rate (HR) signals and present an analysis procedure that uses these features to diagnose diabetes. Through statistical analysis, we have identified the correlation dimension, Poincar{\'{e}} geometry properties (SD2), and recurrence plot properties (REC, DET, Lmean) as useful features. These features differentiate the HR data of diabetic patients from those of patients who do not have the illness, and have been validated by using the AdaBoost classifier with the perceptron weak learner (yielding a classification accuracy of 86{\%}). We then developed a novel diabetic integrated index (DII) that is a combination of these nonlinear features. The DII indicates whether a particular HR signal was taken from a person with diabetes. This index aids the automatic detection of diabetes, thereby allowing a more objective assessment and freeing medical professionals for other tasks. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The aim of this work is to use recurrence-based measures in an attempt to improve the classification performance obtained with a classical spectral approaches for a fivecommand SSVEP-BCI system. For both recurrence and spectral spaces, features were selected using a cluster measure defined by the Davies-Bouldin index and the classification stage was based on linear discriminant analysis. As the main result, it was found that the threshold $\epsilon$ of the recurrence plot, chosen so as to yield a recurrence rate of 2.5{\%}, defined the key discriminant feature, typically providing a mean classification error of less than 2{\%} when information from 4 electrodes was used. Such classification performancewas significantly better than that attained using spectral features, which strongly indicates that RQA is an efficient feature extraction technique for BCI.},

Meanwhile, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is applied to evaluate the performance of the aforementioned measures to identify the grasp movements. The experimental results show that the recognition rate (99.1{\%}) based on the combination of linear and nonlinear measures is much higher than those with only linear measures (93.4{\%}) or nonlinear measures (88.1{\%}).

Without TDE, we lose the assumption that phase-space trajectories are being preserved in the recurrence plot. Thus, analysis has been typically limited to clustering fixation locations in the image space, instead of clustering data sequences in the phase space.

Taking wholesale cabbage prices as an example, a multiple test methodology has been adopted to identify the nonlinearity, fractality, and chaos of the data. The approaches used include the R/S analysis, the BDS test, the power spectra, the recurrence plot, the largest Lyapunov exponent, the Kolmogorov entropy, and the correlation dimension. The results show that there is chaos in agricultural wholesale price data, which provides a good theoretical basis for selecting reasonable forecasting models as prediction techniques based on chaos theory can be applied to forecasting agricultural prices.},

The RQA, a nonlinear signal processing method, is applied to extracting recurrence plot entropy features from vibration signals as input to build an autoregression (AR) model. This AR model is used to estimate parameters of the dynamic model of the bearing, and the Kalman filter is then utilized to obtain optimal prediction results on the bearing degradation state from its dynamic model. Case studies performed on two test-to-failure experiments indicate that the presented approach can predict occurrence of the bearing failure 50 min in advance.},

abstract = {Metal cutting is a complex nonlinear dynamical process. Analysis of signals from turning operation shows that the machining exhibits a low-dimensional chaos. The self-excited vibration caused by the regenerative effect, usually called chatter, can be created during machining by increasing one cutting parameter, while keeping all other cutting parameters constant. A cross-recurrence plot (CRP) enables the study of synchronisation or time differences in two time series. CRP-based methodology is used to find the point of transition from normal cutting to chatter cutting. In this method, two signals, one input signal (power to the lathe motor) and one output signal (cutting tool vibration), are recorded simultaneously at a constant sampling rate during cutting. A time series is generated from the recorded values, and cross-recurrence plot is prepared. This CRP can be quantified using Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA). Abrupt variation in the CRQA parameters indicates the onset of chatter vibration. The results are verified using permutation entropy (PE) to detect the onset of chatter from the time series. The present study ascertains that this CRP-based methodology is capable of recognising the transition from regular cutting to the chatter cutting irrespective of the machining parameters or work piece material.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an online sleep apnea detection method based on heart rate complexity as measured by recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) statistics of heart rate variability (HRV) data. RQA statistics can capture nonlinear dynamics of a complex cardio-respiratory system during obstructive sleep apnea. In order to obtain a more robust measurement of the nonstationarity of the cardio-respiratory system, we use different fixed amount of neighbor thresholdings for recurrence plot calculation. We integrate a feature selection algorithm based on conditional mutual information to select the most informative RQA features for classification, and hence, to speed up the realtime classification process without degrading the performance of the system. Two types of binary classifiers, i.e., support vector machine and neural network, are used to differentiate apnea from normal sleep. A soft decision fusion rule is developed to combine the results of these classifiers in order to improve the classification performance of the whole system. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better classification results compared with previous recurrence analysis based approach. We also show that our method is flexible and a strong candidate for a real efficient sleep apnea detection system.},

abstract = {Structures in recurrence plots (RPs), preserving the rich information of nonlinear invariants and trajectory characteristics, have been increasingly analyzed in dynamic discrimination studies. The conventional analysis of RPs is mainly focused on quantifying the overall diagonal and vertical line structures through a method, called recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). This study extensively explores the information in RPs by quantifying local complex RP structures. To do this, an approach was developed to analyze the combination of three major RQA variables: determinism, laminarity, and recurrence rate (DLR) in a metawindow moving over a RP. It was then evaluated in two experiments discriminating (1) ideal nonlinear dynamic series emulated from the Lorenz system with different control parameters and (2) data sets of human heart rate regulations with normal sinus rhythms (n = 18) and congestive heart failure (n = 29). Finally, the DLR was compared with seven major RQA variables in terms of discriminatory power, measured by standardized mean difference (DSMD). In the two experiments, DLR resulted in the highest discriminatory power with DSMD = 2.53 and 0.98, respectively, which were 7.41 and 2.09 times the best performance from RQA. The study also revealed that the optimal RP structures for the discriminations were neither typical diagonal structures nor vertical structures. These findings indicate that local complex RP structures contain some rich information unexploited by RQA. Therefore, future research to extensively analyze complex RP structures would potentially improve the effectiveness of the RP analysis in dynamic discrimination studies.},

From the results we can see that both of the methods can be used to analyze the characteristics of different flow patterns efficiently. Compared to the recurrence plot, the order recurrence plot clearly shows the entire texture of blocks, and it is more intuitive and effective than the linear texture presented by the recurrence plot. From the visual effect of view, the order recurrence plot has more advantage in distinguishing different flow patterns while the texture effect of recurrence plot is unobvious. Taking the simplicity and effectiveness into consideration, the order recurrence plot will be widely applied to characterize two-phase non-linear systems or other fields.},

abstract = {Objective. To analyze the accuracy of recurrence measurements, both isolated and combined, to assess the intensity of vocal disorders in children. Method. A total of 93 children of both sexes (48 girls and 45 boys), aged between 3 and 10 years, participated. The vocal-deviation intensity was evaluated by the consensus of three speech therapists from the pronunciation of vowel /$\epsilon$/using the visual analog scale. In the acoustic analysis, eight recurrence plot characteristics were evaluated and extracted with neighborhood radius values that maintained the recurrence rate at 1{\%}, 2{\%}, 3{\%}, 4{\%}, and 5{\%}. The classification was performed using quadratic discriminant analysis applied for individual and combined measurements. The performance was evaluated by measuring the accuracy, which related the cases correctly classified to all the analyzed cases. Results. In the classification cases concerning individual measure performance, the trapping time and maximum length of the diagonal lines showed the best classification potential to discriminate between healthy and disturbed voices, with accuracy rates above 80{\%}. In the healthy and mild deviation cases, the trend (TREND) measure was also relevant. For the mild versus moderate deviation classification, the best performance was obtained by the TREND measure (85.00{\%} ± 7.64{\%}). A gain was obtained in the classification rate when the measures of recurrence were combined, reaching an accuracy of 95.00{\%} ± 5.00{\%}, for discriminating between healthy voices and those with mild deviation. Conclusions. The measures of recurrence, either alone or combined, may be useful in detecting healthy and disturbed voices and in differentiating the intensity of vocal disorders in children.},

Non-stationary signals are present in real-life phenomena such as underwater mammal's vocalizations, human speech, ultrasonic monitoring, detection of electrical discharges, transients, wireless communications, etc. This is why a large number of approaches for non-stationary signal analysis are developed such as wavelet analysis, higher order statistics, or quadratic time-frequency analysis. Following the context, the methods defined around the concept of Recurrence Plot Analysis (RPA) constitute an interesting way of analyzing non-stationary signals and, particularly, the transient ones. Starting from the phase space and the recurrence matrix, new approaches [the angular distance, recurrence-based autocorrelation function (ACF), average-magnitude difference function (AMDF) and time-distributed recurrence (TDR)] are introduced in order to extract information about the non-stationary signals, specific to different applications. Comparisons with existing analysis methods are presented, proving the interest and the potential of the RPA-based approaches.},

abstract = {Background: Traditional mapping of atrial fibrillati on (AF) is limited by changing electrogram morphologies and variable cycle lengths. Objective: We tested the hypothesis that morphology recurrence plot analysis would identify sites of stable and repeatable electro-gram morphology patterns. Methods: AF electrograms recorded from left atrial (LA) and right atrial (RA) sites in 19 patients (10 men; mean age 59 ± 10 years) before AF ablation were analyzed. Morphology recurrence plots for each electrogram recording were created by cross-correlation of each automatically detected activation with every other activation in the recording. A recurrence percentage, the percentage of the most common morphology, and the mean cycle length of activations with the most recurrent morphology were computed. Results: The morphology recurrence plots commonly showed checkerboard patterns of alternating high and low cross-correlation values, indicating periodic recurrences in morphologies. The mean recurrence percentage for all sites and all patients was 38 ± 25{\%}. The highest recurrence percentage per patient averaged 83 ± 17{\%}. The highest recurrence percentage was located in the RA in 5 patients and in the LA in 14 patients. Patients with sites of shortest mean cycle length of activations with the most recurrent morphology in the LA and RA had ablation failure rates of 25{\%} and 100{\%}, respectively (hazard ratio 4.95; P = .05). Conclusion: A new technique to characterize electrogram morphology recurrence demonstrated that there is a distribution of sites with high and low repeatability of electrogram morphologies. Sites with rapid activation of highly repetitive morphology patterns may be critical to sustaining AF. Further testing of this approach to map and ablate AF sources is warranted.},

abstract = {Previous studies have indicated that the chronic effects of exposure to low-frequency noise causes annoyance. However, during the past two decades, most studies have employed questionnaires to characterize the effects of noise on psychosomatic responses. This study investigated cardiovascular activity changes in exposure to low-frequency noise for various noise intensities by using recurrence plot analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) estimation. The authors hypothesized that distinct noise intensities affect cardiovascular activity, which would be reflected in the HRV and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) parameters. The test intensities of noises were no noise, 70-dBC, 80-dBC, and 90-dBC. Each noise level was sustained for 5 min, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded simultaneously. The cardiovascular responses were evaluated using RQA of the beat-to-beat (RR) intervals obtained from ECG signals. The results showed that the mean RR interval variability and mean blood pressure did not substantially change relative to the noise levels. However, the length of the longest diagonal line (L{\textless}inf{\textgreater}max{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) of the RQA of the background noise (no noise) condition was significantly lower than the 70-dBC, 80-dBC, and 90-dBC noise levels. The laminarity showed significant changes in the noise levels of various intensities. In conclusion, the RQA-based measures appear to be an effective tool for exposure to low-frequency noise, even in short-term HRV time series. {\textcopyright} (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this article was to introduce an important tool, cross-recurrence analysis, to speech production applications by showing how it can be adapted to evaluate the similarity of multivariate patterns of articulatory motion. The method differs from classical applications of cross-recurrence analysis because no phase space reconstruction is conducted, and a cleaning algorithm removes the artifacts from the recurrence plot. The main features of the proposed approach are robustness to nonstationarity and efficient separation of amplitude variability from temporal variability. Method: The authors tested these claims by applying their method to synthetic stimuli whose variability had been carefully controlled. The proposed method was also demonstrated in a practical application: It was used to investigate the role of biomechanical constraints in articulatory reorganization as a consequence of speeded repetition of CVCV utterances containing a labial and a coronal consonant. Results: Overall, the proposed approach provided more reliable results than other methods, particularly in the presence of high variability. Conclusion: The proposed method is a useful and appropriate tool for quantifying similarity and dissimilarity in patterns of speech articulator movement, especially in such research areas as speech errors and pathologies, where unpredictable divergent behavior is expected.},

Interaction between the prey and an intermediate predator follows the Volterra scheme (with Holling type IV functional response), while that between the top predator and its prey depends on Beddington-DeAngelis type functional response. Stability switches and Hopf-bifurcation occurs when the delay crosses some critical value. Model system exhibits irregular behavior when the interference is high or gestation period is larger than its critical value. Furthermore, the direction of Hopf-bifurcation and the stability of the bifurcating periodic solutions are determined using the center manifold theorem and normal form theory. Computer simulations have been carried out to illustrate the analytical findings. Different diagnostic tests, like, initial sensitivity, Lyapunov exponent, recurrence plot tests ensure the complex dynamical behavior of the model system. Finally, we observed the subcritical Hopf-bifurcation phenomena in the designed model system and the bifurcating periodic solution is unstable for the considered set of parameter values.},

Methods: One minute 12-lead ECG was recorded before CA from 62 patients with AF (32 paroxysmal AF; 45 men; age 57±10 years). Organisation of atrial waveforms from i) TQ intervals in V1and ii) QRST suppressed continuous AF waveforms (CAFW), were quantified using RPI: percentage recurrence (PR), percentage determinism (PD), entropy of recurrence (ER). Ability to predict acute (terminating vs. non-terminating AF), 3-month and 6-month postoperative outcome (AF vs. AF free) were assessed. Results: RPI either by TQ or CAFW analysis did not change significantly with acute outcome. Patients arrhythmia-free at 6-month follow-up had higher organisation in TQ intervals by PD (. p{\textless}0.05) and ER (. p{\textless}0.005) and both were significant predictors of 6-month outcome (PD (AUC=0.67, p{\textless}0.05) and ER (AUC=0.72, p{\textless}0.005)).

The aim of this work is to use recurrence-based measures in an attempt to improve the classification performance obtained with a classical spectral approaches for a fivecommand SSVEP-BCI system. For both recurrence and spectral spaces, features were selected using a cluster measure defined by the Davies-Bouldin index and the classification stage was based on linear discriminant analysis. As the main result, it was found that the threshold $\epsilon$ of the recurrence plot, chosen so as to yield a recurrence rate of 2.5{\%}, defined the key discriminant feature, typically providing a mean classification error of less than 2{\%} when information from 4 electrodes was used. Such classification performancewas significantly better than that attained using spectral features, which strongly indicates that RQA is an efficient feature extraction technique for BCI.},

Generally, the change of structural characteristics due to damage is analyzed by observing frequencies, mode shapes, damping, etc. However, the change of those modal features due to damage is minor, so that detecting the location of damage is difficult. Recently, an attractor-based monitoring system has been proposed. The study by Nichols et al.

The peripheral blood volume is another variable of the cardiovascular control system with a crucial role during active standing since re-distribution of blood volume is necessary to counteract the gravity force and to provide enough blood supply to vital organs. Beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic systolic blood volume (SBV) oscillations may be useful to study the cardiovascular control if it is considered as a regulatory system with relevant local differences compared to blood pressure regulation. There are no previous reports of the SBV dynamical response to active standing. In this work we study simultaneously the dynamical response of heart-beat interval, SBP and SBV to active standing through comparison of RQA indexes evaluated during supine position and during active standing in 19 healthy volunteers. We show that in response to orthostatic stress, SBV oscillations have dynamic changes similar, but not identical, to SBP and the heart-beat interval. This suggests that these three variables are complementary for a better evaluation of the cardiovascular dynamics.},

This paper presents a novel method based on recurrence plot for detecting multiple change-points in multivariate time series. Bhattacharyya distance function is applied to improve the recurrence plot generation so as to capture the dependency change among variables. A window-based detection algorithm is proposed to capture the change- points quickly and automatically. With experiments on artificial and real datasets, we show that the algorithm has made improvement to traditional recurrence plot, is able to handle noisy data with optimized parameter, and can cope with complex situation like human activity and micro-blog events monitoring.},

abstract = {Recognizing human hand grasp movements through surface electromyogram (sEMG) is a challenging task. In this paper, we investigated nonlinear measures based on recurrence plot, as a tool to evaluate the hidden dynamical characteristics of sEMG during four different hand movements. A series of experimental tests in this study show that the dynamical characteristics of sEMG data with recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) can distinguish different hand grasp movements. Meanwhile, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is applied to evaluate the performance of the aforementioned measures to identify the grasp movements. The experimental results show that the recognition rate (99.1{\%}) based on the combination of linear and nonlinear measures is much higher than those with only linear measures (93.4{\%}) or nonlinear measures (88.1{\%}). These results suggest that the RQA measures might be a potential tool to reveal the sEMG hidden characteristics of hand grasp movements and an effective supplement for the traditional linear grasp recognition methods.},

Both textured insoles and athletic tape are deemed to be beneficial for enhancing proprioception because of the capacity for exploiting availability of "sensorimotor system noise", which enhances movement control and individuals' joint position perception. It was hypothesized that the compression feature in knee length socks would provide greater stimulation to lower leg mechanoreceptors, and help participants achieve better balance control. Participants (N=8) performed a 30-s Romberg static balance test protocol under three conditions (barefoot; wearing commercial socks; wearing textured compression socks), in a counterbalanced order, with four levels of performance difficulty: (1) standing on a stable surface with open eyes (SO); (2) a stable surface with closed eyes (SC); (3) a foam surface with open eyes (FO); and (4) a foam surface with closed eyes (FC). Two commonly investigated recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) measures ({\%} Det and entropy) were extracted from the recurrence plot for multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). There were no significant interactions between the levels of performance difficulty and the sock treatments, p{\textgreater} 0.05 for both {\%} Det and entropy in both Anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions. There was no significant main effect of sock treatments, P{\textgreater} 0.05). However, a main effect for performance difficulty on {\%} Det and entropy was observed in both AP and ML directions. The RQA measures demonstrated that the sensory systems in elderly individuals are able to aid the adaptive re-organization of postural behaviour in response to changing task constraints (performance difficulty levels). {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The aim of this work is to use recurrence-based measures in an attempt to improve the classification performance obtained with a classical spectral approaches for a five- command SSVEP-BCI system. For both recurrence and spectral spaces, features were selected using a cluster measure defined by the Davies-Bouldin index and the classification stage was based on linear discriminant analysis. As the main result, it was found that the threshold $\epsilon$ of the recurrence plot, chosen so as to yield a recurrence rate of 2.5{\%}, defined the key discriminant feature, typically providing a mean classification error of less than 2{\%} when information from 4 electrodes was used. Such classification performancewas significantly better than that attained using spectral features,which strongly indicates that RQAis an efficient feature extraction technique for BCI.},

However, it is uncertain whether there is a chronic sleep stage-dependent linear and nonlinear cardiac autonomic impairment in OSA.

Subjects underwent in-laboratory overnight polysomnography with electrocardiography recording. HRV indices were obtained by analyzing the R-R intervals (RRis) in 5-min apnea-free samples by the linear frequency domain [low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and LF/HF], Poincar{\'{e}} plot [standard deviation (SD1) and (SD2)], recurrence plot [mean line length (Lmean)], recurrence rate (REC), determinism (DET), and Shannon entropy (ShanEn).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The MOSA group presented with higher LF, LF/HF, and DET indices compared to NonOSA as well as a lower parasympathetic index (HF), suggesting sympathetic hyperactivity in MOSA subjects.

abstract = {Signal analysis is one of the finest scientific techniques in communication theory. Some quantitative and qualitative measures de-scribe the pattern of a music signal, vary from one to another. Same musical recital, when played by different instrumentalists, generates different types of music patterns. The reason behind various patterns is the psycho-acoustic measures – Dynamics, Timber, Tonality and Rhythm, varies in each time. However, the psycho-acoustic study of the music signals does not reveal any idea about the similarity be-tween the signals. For such cases, study of synchronization of long-term nonlinear dynamics may provide effective results. In this context, phase synchronization (PS) is one of the measures to show synchro-nization between two non-identical signals. In fact, it is very critical to investigate any other kind of synchronization for experimental con-dition, because those are completely non identical signals. Also, there exists equivalence between the phases and the distances of the diago-nal line in Recurrence plot (RP) of the signals, which is quantifiable by the recurrence quantification measure $\tau$ -recurrence rate. This paper considers two nonlinear music signals based on same raga played by two eminent sitar instrumentalists as two non-identical sources. The psycho-acoustic study shows how the Dynamics, Timber, Tonality and Rhythm vary for the two music signals. Then, long term analysis in the form of phase space reconstruction is performed, which reveals the chaotic phase spaces for both the signals. From the RP of both the phase spaces, $\tau$ -recurrence rate is calculated. Finally by the correlation of normalized tau-recurrence rate of their 3D phase spaces and the PS of the two music signals has been established. The numerical results well support the analysis.},

abstract = {Transfer of nucleotide strings in the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genome is investigated to exhibit periodic and non-periodic correlation structures by using the recurrence plot method and the phase space reconstruction technique. The periodic correlation structures are generated by periodic transfer of several substrings in long periodic or non-periodic nucleotide strings embedded in the coding regions of genes. The non-periodic correlation structures are generated by non-periodic transfer of several substrings covering or overlapping with the coding regions of genes. In the periodic and non-periodic transfer, some gaps divide the long nucleotide strings into the substrings and prevent their global transfer. Most of the gaps are either the replacement of one base or the insertion/reduction of one base. In the reconstructed phase space, the points generated from two or three steps for the continuous iterative transfer via the second maximal distance can be fitted by two lines. It partly reveals an intrinsic dynamics in the transfer of nucleotide strings. Due to the comparison of the relative positions and lengths, the substrings concerned with the non-periodic correlation structures are almost identical to the mobile elements annotated in the genome. The mobile elements are thus endowed with the basic results on the correlation structures.},

abstract = {Question: In recent years, it is reported that brain activity is not originated from the region by itself, but originated from several regions. In this study, we examined the functional connectivity among the three regions in both hemispheres, (1) pre-motor area and supplementary motor area, (2) primary motor area and (3) primary sensory area on performing motor execution or imagery. Methods: NIRS refers Near Infra-red spectroscopy, with which the brain activity can be measured non-invasively and low-restrictedly. Using a few wavelengths of near infra-red light, the relative hemoglobin concentration changes evoked by the brain activity can be measured. Recently, many studies have been reported in clinical cases such as rehabilitation or psychic medicine. In this research, we detect the functional connectivity in NIRS data using joint recurrence plot (Marwon, 2007). Recurrence plot is one of the useful method in time series analysis, which visualize the inner structure of a time series. Moreover, joint recurrence plot detects the relationships between two time series by a statistical method (Iwayama, 2012). Eleven normal subjects (age: 23-36years) participated in the examination. All of them were judged as the right-handed with Edinburgh handedness inventory. With pacing visual stimuli, subjects are instructed to execute grasping or to image grasping hands during task periods. A session consists of pre-task (20s), task (20s) and post-task (20s). Session was repeated five times in each measurement. All experiment were performed according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and under the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Tokyo Denki University. Written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects after the explanation of the natural and possible consequences of the study. Results and conclusions: In motor imagery task, the functional connectivity are significantly larger in the premotor cortex and the supplementary cortex between both hemispheres. On the other hand, no significant difference in functional connectivity is found in motor execution. Our study shows that joint recurrence plot can be a useful tool for detecting functional connectivity on-line, therefore, it could contribute the rehabilitation or the brain machine interface.},

abstract = {In the present paper, I study a prey-predator model with multiple time delays where the predator population is regarded as generalist. For this regard, I consider a Holling-Tanner prey-predator system where a constant time delay is incorporated in the logistic growth of the prey to represent a delayed density dependent feedback mechanism and the second time delay is considered to account for the length of the gestation period of the predator. Predator's interference in predator-prey relationship provides better descriptions of predator's feeding over a range of prey-predator abundances, so the predator's functional response here is considered to be Type II ratio-dependent. In accordance with previous studies, it is observed that delay destabilizes the system, in general, and stability loss occurs via Hopf bifurcation. There exist critical values of delay parameters below which the coexistence equilibrium is stable and above which it is unstable. Hopf bifurcation occurs when delay parameters cross their critical values. When delay parameters are large enough than their critical values, the system exhibits chaotic behavior and this abnormal behavior may be controlled by refuge. Numerical computation is also performed to validate different theoretical results. Lyapunov exponent, recurrence plot, and power spectral density confirm the chaotic dynamical behaviors.},

Within one of the most used BCIs paradigms, that based on Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), such task is classically performed in the spectral domain, albeit it does not necessarily provide the best achievable performance. The aim of this work is to use recurrence-based measures in an attempt to improve the classification performance obtained with a classical spectral approaches for a fivecommand SSVEP-BCI system. For both recurrence and spectral spaces, features were selected using a cluster measure defined by the Davies-Bouldin index and the classification stage was based on linear discriminant analysis. As the main result, it was found that the threshold $\epsilon$ of the recurrence plot, chosen so as to yield a recurrence rate of 2.5{\%}, defined the key discriminant feature, typically providing a mean classification error of less than 2{\%} when information from 4 electrodes was used. Such classification performancewas significantly better than that attained using spectral features, which strongly indicates that RQA is an efficient feature extraction technique for BCI.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an online sleep apnea detection method based on heart rate complexity as measured by recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) statistics of heart rate variability (HRV) data. RQA statistics can capture nonlinear dynamics of a complex cardiorespiratory system during obstructive sleep apnea. In order to obtain a more robust measurement of the nonstationarity of the cardiorespiratory system, we use different fixed amount of neighbor thresholdings for recurrence plot calculation. We integrate a feature selection algorithm based on conditional mutual information to select the most informative RQA features for classification, and hence, to speed up the real-time classification process without degrading the performance of the system. Two types of binary classifiers, i.e., support vector machine and neural network, are used to differentiate apnea from normal sleep. A soft decision fusion rule is developed to combine the results of these classifiers in order to improve the classification performance of the whole system. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better classification results compared with the previous recurrence analysis-based approach. We also show that our method is flexible and a strong candidate for a real efficient sleep apnea detection system. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. It is a challenge to achieve a satisfactory rate for the sEMG pattern recognition, which is becoming the main focus of the on-going research in rehabilitation and prosthetics. This chapter introduces nonlinear feature extraction and nonlinear classification approaches to efficiently identify different human hand manipulations based on surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The recurrence plot is employed to represent dynamical characteristics of sEMG during hand movements as nonlinear features. Fuzzy Gaussian Mixture Models (FGMMs) are proposed and employed as a nonlinear classifier to recognise these hand grasps and in-hand manipulations captured from different subjects. Results from a variety of experiments comparing 14 individual features, 19 multi-features and 4 classifiers demonstrate the proposed nonlinear measures provide essential supplemental information to the good performance in multi-features. It also proves that FGMMs with capacity of modelling nonlinear datasets outperform commonly used approaches including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Specially, the best performance with the recognition rate of 96.7{\%} is achieved by FGMMs with the multi-feature combining Willison Amplitude (WAMP) and Determinism (DET).},

abstract = {Rationale: In the last decade, a lot of efforts were made to build a system for home monitoring of epileptic patients. Since the gold standard, video/EEG (electroencephalography), is uncomfortable for long-term monitoring and labor-intensive for the care givers, our main focus lies on the detection of motor convulsions related to the epileptic seizures using user-friendly motion sensors. Herein, four triaxial accelerometers attached to the wrists and ankles are used. Methods: Our study includes 10 refractory epilepsy children with (tonic-)clonic seizures. Patients were monitored during several nights using both video/EEG and accelerometry (ACM). Annotations were determined by an EEG specialist applying the ILEA (International League against Epilepsy) recommendations. The recordings are divided into 2-second epochs with 75{\%} overlap, but only epochs with motion activity (standard deviation within the epoch higher than 10 mg) are kept for further analysis. Multiple features from the time, frequency, continuous wavelet transform, packet wavelet transform and cross-recurrence plot domain are 285 extracted from each epoch. Using feature selection methods (filter method based on mutual information in the first stage, and wrapper LS-SVM (Least-Square Support Vector Machines) method with forward search in the second stage), this feature set is reduced to two most relevant features. In addition to the first five clonic seizures of patients 30, 40 and 51 (see Table 1), five more clonic seizures from four patients are included in the feature selection and LS-SVM tuning and training (which are not included in Table 1 since their data were not used for testing). Tuning of the LS-SVM model with a radial basis function kernel is performed with 5-fold crossvalidation and maximization of the F1-score parameter. The obtained model is tested both on the rest of the data of three patients with clonic seizures, and on data from patients with tonic-clonic seizures. The classification performances are estimated describing sensitivity (at least one epoch within the seizure is detected), mean latency (delay between the first detected epoch and clinical onset of the seizure) and specificity on the level of epoch detection. Results: Table 1 summarizes the classification results. Even though the model is built for the detection of clonic seizures, it is able to detect the tonic-clonic seizures of other patients. However, 24 clonic seizures are missed. This is partially explained by the morphology of these seizures. While the seizures B and C on Figure 1 are labeled as clonic seizures, compared to the seizure A, these seizures do not involve the four limbs so much; in addition, they are quite weak and short. Excluding seizures with lower motor manifestations of monitored limbs would enhance the system performance. Conclusions: Accelerometry is capable of detecting motor seizures with a repetitive rhythm. Using only an ACM system, nocturnal monitoring of epileptic children is both comfortable and userfriendly. It enables long-term monitoring, better treatment management and easier follow-ups. Classification performance ∗TC = tonic-clonic and C = clonic seizure (Table Presented)(Figure Presented).},

All of these cell lines produced growth factor activity for IL-6-dependent hybridoma cells (7TD1), which was completely neutralized by the monoclonal anti-IL-6-antibody 6B4. IL-6 expression was also evident at the mRNA level using a murine IL-6-specific cDNA probe. In 32Dcl.23 cells (2 x 10(5)/ml) stimulated for 24 hr with serial dilutions of purified murine IL-3, a positive correlation was found between the IL-3 dose and the amount of IL-6 measured in the conditioned media. At 24 hr this correlation was not evident at the mRNA level. However, prolonged exposure of 32Dcl.23 cells (up to 72 hr) to either a high (60 U/ml) or a low IL-3 concentration (1 U/ml) revealed a time-dependent increase and decrease, respectively, of IL-6 mRNA levels. At both IL-3 concentrations 32Dcl.23 cells remained in a fully viable and proliferative state. The influence of IL-3 on IL-6 release could be specifically counteracted by anti-IL-3-antiserum. IL-6 added alone or in concert with IL-3 did not stimulate 32Dcl.23 proliferation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

In this study, we evaluate the concentration-dependent effect of the propofol on long-range frontal-temporal synchronization of EEG signals collected from eight subjects during a controlled induction and recovery design. We used order patterns cross recurrence plot and provide an index named order pattern laminarity (OPL) to assess changes in neuronal synchronization as the mechanism forming the foundation of conscious perception. The prediction probability of 0.9 and 0.84 for OPL and BIS specified that the OPL index correlated more strongly with effect-site propofol concentration. Also, our new index makes faster reaction to transients in EEG recordings based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model parameters and demonstrates less variability at the point of loss of consciousness (standard deviation of 0.04 for OPL compared with 0.09 for BIS index). The result show that the OPL index can estimate anesthetic state of patient more efficiently than the BIS index in lightly sedated state with more tolerant of artifacts.},

Electrochemical noise current-time series with an open circuit are analyzed to determine the magnitude of the interaction of corrosion microcells in presence and in absence of a corrosion inhibitor. The corrosion dynamic shows a complex nature. The interaction among corrosion micro-cells changes depends on a localization index (LI). A higher L{\textless}inf{\textgreater}I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} implies a more discrete distribution of corrosion micro-cells along with a significant interaction, and a corrosion system auto-organization. {\textcopyright} 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

Inspired by the recurrence plot theory, we introduce the concept of Joint Self-Similarity Volume (Joint-SSV) to model this sparse action manifold, and hence propose a new optimized rank-1 tensor approximation of the Joint-SSV to obtain compact low-dimensional descriptors that very accurately characterize an action in a video sequence. We show that these descriptor vectors make it possible to recognize actions without explicitly aligning the videos in time in order to compensate for speed of execution or differences in video frame rates. Moreover, we show that the proposed method is generic, in the sense that it can be applied using different low-level features, such as silhouettes, tracked points, histogram of oriented gradients, and so forth. Therefore, our method does not necessarily require explicit tracking of features in the space-time volume. Our experimental results on five public data sets demonstrate that our method produces promising results and outperforms many baseline methods.},

In this work, we propose a method which uses the mapogram as a similarity measure between spatially distributed data instances at different time points. The resulting similarity values of the pairwise comparison are used to construct a recurrence plot in order to benefit from established tools of recurrence quantification analysis and recurrence network analysis. In contrast to other recurrence tools for this purpose, the mapogram approach allows the specific focus on different spatial scales that can be used in a multi-scale analysis of spatio-temporal dynamics. We illustrate this approach by application on mixed dynamics, such as traveling parallel wave fronts with additive noise, as well as more complicate examples, pseudo-random numbers and coupled map lattices with a semi-logistic mapping rule. Especially the complicate examples show the usefulness of the multi-scale consideration in order to take spatial pattern of different scales and with different rhythms into account. So, this mapogram approach promises new insights in problems of climatology, ecology, or medicine.},

However, if the similarity threshold $\epsilon$ is zero, we show that the recurrence rate (RR), the determinism (DET) and other diagonal line based RQA-measures can be obtained algorithmically taking O(Nlog?(N)) time and O(N) space. Furthermore, for the case of $\epsilon${\textgreater}0 we propose approximations to the RQA-measures that are computable with same complexity. Simulations with autoregressive systems, the logistic map and a Lorenz attractor suggest that the approximation error is small if the dimension of the trajectory and the minimum diagonal line length are small. When applying the approximate determinism to the problem of detecting dynamical transitions we observe that it performs as well as the exact determinism measure.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of heart rate variability (HRV) and its specific parameters as a new approach to assess stress load in cattle. We recorded HRV in 52 calves in three groups and in 31 cows in two groups. In calves we divided Group 1 with no obvious stress load (n=18), Group 2 with external stress load (n=17), and Group 3 with internal stress load from sickness (n=17). In cattle we divided lactating cows (n=21) and nonlactating cows (n=10). HRV parameters were analyzed in the time domain and in the frequency domain. Moreover, we applied Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to quantify nonlinear components of HRV. In calves, linear HRV parameter decreased from Group 1 to Group 3 (P{\textless}.05). However, not a single parameter showed significant differences regarding all three groups. The value of all nonlinear measurements increased at the same time (P{\textless}.05). The only parameter that exhibited significant differences between all three groups was the longest diagonal line segment in the recurrence plot (LMAX) which is inversely related to the Lyapunov exponent. We did not find differences concerning the linear HRV parameters between the two groups in the cows. The nonlinear parameter Determinism showed significant higher values in lactating cows compared to nonlactating cows. The importance of particular HRV-parameters was tested by applying a discriminant analysis approach. In calves and cattle nonlinear parameters were most important to indicate the level of stress load on the animals. Based on the results we assume HRV to be a valuable physiological indicator for stress load in animals. Whereas linear parameters of HRV are supposed to be useful to separate qualitative different level of stress, nonlinear components of HRV distinguish quantitative different challenges for the animals.},

Stress detection via short term (5 minutes) Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has been widely investigated in the last years. Recent improvements in wearable sensing devices and mobile computing raised a new research question: is ultra-short (2 minutes) HRV as effective as the short term one to detect mental stress? This study aimed to answer this research question. Short and ultra-short HRV was compared in 42 healthy subjects (age 25-38 years) undertaking the widely adopted and highly-effective the Stroop Color Word Test (CWT). ECG signals were recorded during rest and stress session using a chest wearable monitoring device, the BioHarness M3 (ZephyrTech, NZ). HRV measures were then extracted and analyzed according to the literature and using validated software tools. Variations between short and ultra-short HRV measures in rest and stress sessions were analysed with the statistical Wilcoxon significance test. The results of the current study suggested that 6 HRV measures are effective in detecting acute mental stress both using short and ultra-short term analysis: Mean RR, Low Frequency power, Sample Entropy, Detrended fluctuation analysis: Short term and Long term fluctuation slope and Mean line length of Recurrence plot analysis. {\&}copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {In the present study, we investigate the phenomenon of transition of a thermoacoustic system involving two-phase flow, from aperiodic oscillations to limit cycle oscillations. Experiments were performed in a laboratory scale model of a spray combustor. A needle spray injector is used to generate a droplet spray having one-dimensional velocity field. This simplified design of the injector helps in keeping away the geometric complexities involved in the real spray atomizers. We investigate the stability of the spray combustor in response to the variation of the flame location inside the combustor. Equivalence ratio is maintained constant throughout the experiment. The dynamics of the system is captured by measuring the unsteady pressure fluctuations present in the system. As the flame location is gradually varied, self-excited high-amplitude acoustic oscillations are observed in the combustor. We observe the transition of the system behavior from low-amplitude aperiodic oscillations to large amplitude limit cycle oscillations occurring through intermittency. This intermittent state mainly consists of a sequence of high-amplitude bursts of periodic oscillations separated by low-amplitude aperiodic regions. Moreover, the experimental results highlight that during intermittency, the maximum amplitude of bursts, near to the onset of intermittency, is as much as three times higher than the maximum amplitude of the limit cycle oscillations. These high-amplitude intermittent loads can have stronger adverse effects on the structural properties of the engine than the low-amplitude cyclic loading caused by the sustained limit cycle oscillations. Evolution of the three different dynamical states of the spray combustion system (viz., stable, intermittency, and limit cycle) is studied in three-dimensional phase space by using a phase space reconstruction tool from the dynamical system theory. We report the first experimental observation of type-II intermittency in a spray combustion system. The statistical distributions of the length of aperiodic (turbulent) phase with respect to the control parameter, first return map and recurrence plot (RP) techniques are employed to confirm the type of intermittency.},

abstract = {The analysis of biomedical signals demonstrating complexity through recurrence plots is challenging. Quantification of recurrences is often biased by sojourn points that hide dynamic transitions. To overcome this problem, time series have previously been embedded at high dimensions. However, no one has quantified the elimination of sojourn points and rate of detection, nor the enhancement of transition detection has been investigated. This paper reports our on-going efforts to improve the detection of dynamic transitions from logistic maps and fetal hearts by reducing sojourn points. Three signal-based recurrence plots were developed, i.e. embedded with specific settings, derivative-based and m-time pattern. Determinism, cross-determinism and percentage of reduced sojourn points were computed to detect transitions. For logistic maps, an increase of 50{\%} and 34.3{\%} in sensitivity of detection over alternatives was achieved by m-time pattern and embedded recurrence plots with specific settings, respectively, and with a 100{\%} specificity. For fetal heart rates, embedded recurrence plots with specific settings provided the best performance, followed by derivative-based recurrence plot, then unembedded recurrence plot using the determinism parameter. The relative errors between healthy and distressed fetuses were 153{\%}, 95{\%} and 91{\%}. More than 50{\%} of sojourn points were eliminated, allowing better detection of heart transitions triggered by gaseous exchange factors. This could be significant in improving the diagnosis of fetal state.},

For h {\textgreater} 0.91, the dynamics is characterized by long intervals of periodicity with abrupt chaotic intervals for short durations. The occurrence of such chaotic intervals increases as the amplitude is increased and finally, the flow field becomes chaotic for the entire time history. This type of dynamical behaviour where irregular chaotic intervals appear in between periodic intervals is known as intermittency. We use time series analysis techniques such as phase space reconstruction and recurrence plots to establish the presence of intermittency. Recurrence plot is an excellent tool for analysing phase space trajectories since it provides good insights into the system dynamics even with a short time series.},

abstract = {This paper develops an effectively intelligent model to forecast short-term wind speed series. A hybrid forecasting technique is proposed based on recurrence plot (RP) and optimized support vector regression (SVR). Wind caused by the interaction of meteorological systems makes itself extremely unsteady and difficult to forecast. To understand the wind system, the wind speed series is analyzed using RP. Then, the SVR model is employed to forecast wind speed, in which the input variables are selected by RP, and two crucial parameters, including the penalties factor and gamma of the kernel function RBF, are optimized by various optimization algorithms. Those optimized algorithms are genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), and cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA). Finally, the optimized SVR models, including COA-SVR, PSO-SVR, and GA-SVR, are evaluated based on some criteria and a hypothesis test. The experimental results show that (1) analysis of RP reveals that wind speed has short-term predictability on a short-term time scale, (2) the performance of the COA-SVR model is superior to that of the PSO-SVR and GA-SVR methods, especially for the jumping samplings, and (3) the COA-SVR method is statistically robust in multi-step-ahead prediction and can be applied to practical wind farm applications.},

abstract = {Extracting frequency-derived parameters allows for the identification and characterization of acoustic events, such as those obtained in passive acoustic monitoring applications. Situations where it is difficult to achieve the desired frequency resolution to distinguish between similar events occur, for example, in short time oscillating events. One feasible approach to make discrimination among such events is by measuring the complexity or the presence of non-linearities in a time series. Available techniques include the delay vector variance (DVV) and recurrence plot (RP) analysis, which have been used independently for statistical testing, however, the similarities between these two techniques have so far been overlooked. This work suggests a method that combines the DVV method with the recurrence quantification analysis parameters of the RP graphs for the characterization of short oscillating events. In order to establish the confidence intervals, a variant of the pseudo-periodic surrogate algorithm is proposed. This allows one to eliminate the fine details that may indicate the presence of non-linear dynamics, without having to add a large amount of noise, while preserving more efficiently the phase-space shape. The algorithm is verified on both synthetic and real world time series.},

We introduce a new approach that applies recurrence plot (RP) construction followed by recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to epicardial atrial electrograms, recorded with a high-density grid of electrodes. In 32 patients with no history of AF (aAF, n=11), paroxysmal AF (PAF, n=12) and persistent AF (persAF, n=9), RPs were constructed using a phase space electrogram embedding dimension equal to the estimated AF cycle length. Spatial information was incorporated by 1) averaging the recurrence over all electrodes, and 2) by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to the matrix of embedded electrograms and selecting the first principal component as a representation of spatial diversity. Standard RQA parameters were computed on the constructed RPs and correlated to the number of fibrillation waves per AF cycle (NW). Averaged RP RQA parameters showed no correlation with NW. Correlations improved when applying PCA, with maximum correlation achieved between RP threshold and NW (RR1{\%}, r=0.68, p {\textless}; 0.001) and RP determinism (DET, r=-0.64, p {\textless}; 0.001).

abstract = {Multi-scale analysis and non-linear analysis were combined to investigate the hydrodynamics of fluidized beds with and without horizontal tubes. Pressure fluctuations were measured and analyzed employing discrete wavelet analysis, recurrence plot analysis, and recurrence quantification analysis. A systematic procedure was followed to determine wavelet parameters. At low gas velocities, the energy of macro-structures reduces with the addition of the first tube and then increases with the addition of a second tube. However, there is no notable difference at high gas velocities. Determinism is high for the bed without tubes, which can be attributed to the periodic behavior of bubbles. Determinism decreases with the addition of tubes because the breakage of bubbles results in less periodic behavior. The three methods of analysis used in this study captured the effects of immersed tubes on the hydrodynamics of fluidized beds. Recurrence quantitative analysis was found to be a powerful and easy-to-use method that can capture the nonlinear characteristics of fluidized beds much more quickly than conventional methods of nonlinear analysis. This method can thus be effectively used for the online monitoring of hydrodynamic changes in fluidized beds.},

abstract = {An experiment and a time series analysis have been made on the flow in a rectangular natural convection loop. It was found that the flow reversal occurs in a certain range of the heat flux and Reynolds number, which depends on the cooling water temperature. Based on time series temperature data of the system, an attractor in a state space has been reconstructed. Geometrical structures and orbital instability for this attractor were evaluated by the recurrence plot analysis and a nonlinear prediction by the method of local linear approximation. A nonlinear prediction was applied to the turbulence time series. As a result, a recurrence plot of the predicted time series obtained from the turbulence data has characteristics similar to those of the measured of the unstable flow. This fact suggests that, even when an apparent turbulent flow is observed, a transition to the unstable flow may occur. In order to confirm this conjecture, we have performed another experiment with the addition of a disturbance to the loop. The experimental results are consistent with the chaos analysis. We have successfully shown the validity of the nonlinear prediction and its recurrence plot as a means to evaluate dynamical flow instability.},

abstract = {Reactivity of cattle affects many aspects of animal production (e.g. reduced milk and meat production). Animals have individual differences in temperament and emotional reactivity, and these differences can affect how animals react to stressful and fear-eliciting events. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a good indicator of stress and balance of the autonomous nervous system, and low parasympathetic activity is connected with higher emotional reactivity. The study had two specific aims: (1) to compare HRV in dairy cows for standing and lying postures (no earlier results available), and (2) to assess whether dairy cows' emotional reactivity is connected to their HRV values. Eighteen dairy cows were subjected twice to a handling test (HT): morning (HT1) and afternoon (HT2), to evaluate emotional reactivity (avoidance score, AS). HRV was measured during HT (standing). HRV baseline values, both standing and lying down, were measured one week before HTs. HRV was analyzed with time and frequency domain analyses and with the Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). Heart rate (HR), low-frequency/high-frequency band ratio (LH/HF), {\%} determinism ({\%}DET) and longest diagonal line segment in the recurrence plot (Lmax) were higher (p{\textless}0.05) while the cows were standing than when lying down, whereas the root mean square of successive R-R intervals (RMSSD) (p{\textless}0.05) and power of the high-frequency band (HF) (p{\textless}0.1) were higher while the animals were lying down. HR, the standard deviation of all interbeat intervals (SDNN), RMSSD, HF, power of the low-frequency band (LF), {\%} recurrence ({\%}REC), {\%}DET, Shannon entropy (p{\textless}0.05), and HF (p{\textless}0.1) were higher during the handling test compared to standing baseline values. AS (i.e. tendency to avoid handling) correlated positively with SDNN (r=0.48, p{\textless}0.05), RMSSD (r=0.54, p{\textless}0.05), HF, RMSSD (r=0.46, p{\textless}0.1) and LF (r=0.57, p{\textless}0.05), and negatively with {\%}DET (r=-0.53, p{\textless}0.05), entropy (r=-0.60, p{\textless}0.05) and Lmax (r=-0.55, p{\textless}0.05) in the baseline HRV measurements. AS correlated positively with SDNN (r=0.43, p{\textless}0.1) and HF (r=0.53, p{\textless}0.05) during HT. Some HRV parameters (HR, LF, {\%}REC, {\%}DET) indicated that the handling test may have caused stress to the experimental cows, although some HRV results (SDNN, RMSSD, HF, entropy) were controversial. The correlations between HRV variables and AS suggest that the emotional reactivity of the cow can be assessed from the baseline values of the HRV. It is debatable, however, whether the handling test used in the present study was a good method of causing mild stress in dairy cattle, since it may have even induced a positive emotional state. The posture of the cow affected HRV values as expected (based on results from other species), so that while standing a shift towards more sympathetic dominance was evident. Our results support the idea that linear (time and frequency domain) and non-linear (RQA) methods measuring HRV complement each other, but further research is needed for better understanding of the connection between temperament and HRV.},

abstract = {We present a complex network-based approach to characterizing the geometric properties of chaos by exploiting the pattern of recurrences in phase space. For this purpose, we utilize the basic definition of a recurrence as the mutual proximity of two state vectors in phase space (disregarding time information) and re-interpret the recurrence plot as a graphical representation of the adjacency matrix of a random geometric graph governed by the system's invariant density. The resulting recurrence networks contain exclusively geometric information about thesystem under study,which can be exploited for inferring quantitative information on the geometric properties of the system's attractor without explicitly studying scaling characteristics as in the case of “classical” fractal dimension estimates. Similar as the established recurrence quantification analysis, recurrence networks can be utilized for studying dynamical transitions in non-stationary systems, as well as for automatically discriminating between chaos and order without the necessity of extensive computations typically necessary when inferring this distinction based on the systems' maximum Lyapunov exponents. Moreover, we provide a thorough re-interpretation of two bi- and multivariate generalizations of recurrence plots in terms of complex networks,which allowtracing geometric signatures of asymmetric coupling and complex synchronization processes between two or more chaotic oscillators.},

From our results, we find the different patterns of RPs for magnitude time series before and after the M6.1 Joshua Tree Earthquake. RQA measurements of determinism (DET) and laminarity (LAM) quantifying the order with confidence levels also show peculiar behaviors. It is found that DET and LAM values of the recurrence-based complexity measure significantly increase to a large value at the main shock, and then gradually recovers to a small values after it. The main shock and its aftershock sequences trigger a temporary growth in order and complexity of the deterministic structure in the RP of seismic activity.

abstract = {Given a set of time series, our goal is to identify prototypes that cover the maximum possible amount of occurring subsequences regardless of their order. This scenario appears in the context of the automotive industry, where the objec- tive is to determine operational profiles that comprise frequently recurring driving behavior patterns. This problem can be solved by clustering, however, standard dis- tance measures such as the dynamic time warping distance might not be suitable for this task, because they aim at capturing the cost of aligning two time series rather than rewarding pairwise occurring patterns. In this work, we propose a novel time series distance measure, based on the theoretical foundation of recurrence plots, which enables us to determine the (dis)similarity of multivariate time series that contain segments of similar trajectories at arbitrary positions. We use recurrence quantification analysis to measure the structures observed in recurrence plots and to investigate dynamical properties, such as determinism, which reflect the pairwise (dis)similarity of time series. In experiments on real-life test drives fromVolkswagen, wedemonstrate that clustering multivariate time series using the proposed recurrence plot-based distance measure results in prototypical test drives that cover significantly more recurring patterns than using the same clustering algorithm with dynamic time warping distance.

abstract = {Most of the current approaches in gear fault diagnostic analysis do not provide a clear indication for discrimination between various common faults. This is almost certainly because failure in gear systems is always accompanied with a complex dynamic response. The inherent nonlinearities in geared systems and additional nonlinearity due to faults conspire to make the diagnostics problem extremely complex. The main goal of this paper is to exploit the nonlinear response in an attempt to solve this challenging problem. We aim to demonstrate effective discrimination between four kinds of common defects in gears by utilizing the method of recurrence analysis. We consider a healthy system, a system with a single crack, a system with multiple cracks and a system with a missing tooth. Careful measurements are collected from an experimental set up which is a mock-up of a real industrial gear box system. We develop and apply recurrence plot analysis to this data. Our results show that recurrence analysis parameters such as recurrence rate, trapping time, entropy and maximal diagonal length can be very effective in successful discrimination of gear faults.},

abstract = {Hardly any of the observed black hole accretion disks in X-Ray binaries and active galaxies shows constant flux. When the local stochastic variations of the disk occur at specific regions where a resonant behaviour takes place, there appear the Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs). If the global structure of the flow and its non-linear hydrodynamics affects the fluctuations, the variability is chaotic in the sense of deterministic chaos. Our aim is to solve a problem of the stochastic versus deterministic nature of the black hole binaries vari- ability. We use both observational and analytic methods. We use the recurrence analysis and we study the occurence of long diagonal lines in the recurrence plot of observed data series and compare it to the sur- rogate series. We analyze here the data of two X-Ray binaries - XTE J1550-564, and GX 339-4 observed by Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. In these sources, the non-linear variability is expected because of the global conditions (such as the mean accretion rate) leading to the pos- sible instability of an accretion disk. The thermal-viscous instability and fluctuations around the fixed-point solution occurs at high accretion rate, when the radiation pressure gives dominant contribution to the stress tensor.},

Measuring dynamic component loads directly is possible, but these measurement methods are costly and are difficult to maintain. While the ultimate goal is to estimate the loads from flight state and control system parameters available in most helicopters, a necessary step is understanding the behavior of the loads under different flight conditions. This paper explores the behavior of the main rotor normal bending loads in level flight, steady turn and rolling pullout flight conditions, as well as the potential of computational intelligence methods in understanding the dynamics. Time delay methods, residual variance analysis (gamma test) using genetic algorithms, unsupervised non-linear mapping and recurrence plot and quantification analysis were used. The results from this initial work demonstrate that there are important differences in the load behavior of the main rotor blade under the different flight conditions which must be taken into account when working with machine learning methods for developing prediction models.},

Methods: Sleep was captured from the baseline time series of an ambulatory Holter-style device that combines a single-channel ECG with a three-channel accelerometer. This battery-operated device (CamN-Tech, London, England) captures variability in both heart-rate and movement. We compared the two groups of brain-injured soldiers (with and without PTSD) to each other as well as to a group of age and sex-matched normals. After collecting 24-hours of heart-rate and accelerometer data from each participant at baseline, we separated the sleep segment manually. Sleep was then studied using a commercially available program (NevroKard) for HRV that we adapted to our purpose, as well as through custom programs that we wrote. Sleep and sleep architecture were studied using heart-rate variability (HRV) and movement variability. Results: First, linear metrics of HRV in both time and frequency domains are described. We report results for the tachogram including segmented statistics, trend analysis, histogram, and Poincare plot and autoregressive spectrum. In addition we calculated nonlinear measures of HRV, including our new method for Poincare plot analysis which emphasizes the relationship of asymmetry in SD1 to these clinical conditions. We also made a movie of the recurrence plot of each soldier which we call a Dynamic Poincare. Next, we report nonlinear statistics for sleep such as Approximate Entropy (organization/disorganization of sleep) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (removal of short-term trends to see long-term pattern of the entire sleep time). Taken together, these measures characterize sleep and sleep architecture in TBI and TBI plus PTSD subjects and distinguish these two groups from each other as well as from normal controls. Conclusion: Our results conclude the usefulness of ambulatory HRV time series to characterize sleep and sleep disorders in a mobile population and the specificity of HRV to separate those with TBI from those with TBI plus PTSD.

abstract = {Objective: Identify associations between sway kinematics and the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. Background: Studies in healthy adults have shown that gait variability in LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers was worse than in noncarriers and balance deficits were identified in individuals with a high risk for developing Parkinson's disease (PD) during challenging conditions. The present work extends these earlier studies to investigate sway in healthy asymptomatic LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers, a group of adults with an increased risk of developing PD. Methods: The study was conducted as part of the 'gait Consortium LRRK2 study' funded by the Michael J Fox foundation. Sway measurements were collected using a 3D accelerometer worn on the lower back. Sixty-one non-manifesting LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers (NMC) and 61 non-manifesting non-carriers (NMNC) were studied. Subjects stood quietly for 30 seconds with a comfortable base of support and eyes open. Sixty-four different parameters were calculated from the accelerometer signals: 22 in the time domain, 10 in the frequency domain, and 32 in phase space. To account for multiple comparisons, a threshold of 0.05/6450.0008 was used as the level of significance. Results: The groups were similar with respect to age, gender, height, weight, and cognitive function. Differences between groups were observed in the time domain, frequency domain and phase space. For example, mean velocity of the COM in the medio-lateral (ML) direction (NMC: 0.01±0.008 m/sec, NMNC: 0.026±0.019 m/sec, p{\textless}0.0001) and path length in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction were higher in the non-carriers (NMC: 28.52±0.726 m/sec2, NMNC: 29.37±1.134 m/sec2, p=0.0002). The mean length of the diagonal lines in the recurrence plot in the AP direction, a reflection of the average length of a recurring state, was larger in the carriers (NMC: 5.52±1.29, NMNC: 4.63±0.70, p=0.0003). Conclusions: These results support the existence of subtle motor changes in postural control among asymptomatic G2019S mutation carriers. Time, frequency and phase space measures demonstrate more constrained movements among carriers which reflect decreased sway. Larger scale longitudinal studies are needed to further investigate sway kinematics as a predictor of disease and as a marker for disease progression.},

The better identification of the dynamical system of EEG signal is achieved through the wavelet decomposition of EEG signal. The wavelet filtering is used for preprocessing and the Phase space reconstruction reconstruct the original signal without any external distractions, these methods give a better classification of raw EEG signals as Healthy,Interictal and Ictal. ECOC classification technique give the better classification of the dataset. This technique results an overall accuracy of 98.67{\%} which obtained from the combination of RQA based measures of the raw signal and subbands results. Cross recurrence quantification analysis is the proposed algorithm used in this paper.CRQA is an advanced technique for nonlinear,neurophysiological signals, it provides a group of statistical parameter to analyze the structure of a cross recurrence plot .Artificial neural network is the classifier for the classification of epileptic seizure.An EEG dataset provided by Dr. R.

abstract = {Currently, heart rate variability (HRV) is commonly evaluated using time and frequency domain analysis in the clinical practice. Due to the fact that cardiovascular system is regulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) that also influences HRV, however exhibits rather nonlinear behaviour, it appears more appropriate to apply nonlinear methods to evaluate functioning of ANS. This study presents recurrence analysis as a tool to test the presence of ANS dysfunction that is responsible i.e. for orthostatic (vasovagal) syncope by which abnormal HRV has been demonstrated in the past. Study included 18 patients that experienced vasovagal syncope (mean age 23.7 ± 5.2 years) and 18 healthy subjects (mean age 24.5 ± 3.2, p = 0.85). In all tested subjects, ECG recording was performed during active orthostatic test that comprised two phases (5 min of resting in a supine position and 5 min of active standing). Sequence of R-R intervals (time intervals between two consecutive heart beats derived from ECG) was analysed using standard time (mean RR, mean HR, SDNN, SDHR, RMSSD, NN50 and pNN50) and frequency domain (LF, HF and LF/HF ratio) analysis. Moreover, recurrence analysis was performed (RATIO, DIV, AVDL, MAXV, DET, ENTR, LMAX, TT and LAM). Frequency domain analysis did not demonstrate significant difference between the two groups in any of the parameters during both phases of the test. On the contrary, both time domain analysis and recurrence analysis showed comparable findings in both groups during resting phase of the orthostatic test with a significant change of most tested parameters after stand-up. As the use of time domain HRV may be perceived as problematic regarding their interpretation in short ECG recordings, recurrence analysis appears to be a sensitive tool for detecting ANS dysfunction in patients with vasovagal syncope.},

abstract = {Nowadays, global warming and its resulting environmental changes is a hot topic in different biology research area. Phenology is one effective way of tracking such environmental changes through the study of plant's periodic events and their relationship to climate. One promising research direction in this area relies on the use of vegetation images to track phenology changes over time. In this scenario, the creation of effective image-based plant identification systems is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose the use of a new representation of time series to improve plants recognition rates. This representation, called recurrence plot (RP), is a technique for nonlinear data analysis, which represents repeated events on time series into a two-dimensional representation (an image). Therefore, image descriptors can be used to characterize visual properties from this RP images so that these features can be used as input of a classifier. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses recurrence plot for plant recognition task. Performed experiments show that RP can be a good solution to describe time series. In addition, in a comparison with visual rhythms (VR), another technique used for time series representation, RP shows a better performance to describe texture properties than VR. On the other hand, a correlation analysis and the adoption of a well successful classifier fusion framework show that both representations provide complementary information that is useful for improving classification accuracies.},

abstract = {In progressive stamping processes, condition monitoring based on tonnage signals is of great practical significance. One typical fault in progressive stamping processes is a missing part in one of the die stations due to malfunction of part transfer in the press. One challenging question is how to detect the fault due to the missing part in certain die stations as such a fault often results in die or press damage, but only provides a small change in the tonnage signals. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel automatic process monitoring method using the recurrence plot (RP) method. Along with the developed method, we also provide a detailed interpretation of the representative patterns in the recurrence plot. Then, the corresponding relationship between the RPs and the tonnage signals under different process conditions is fully investigated. To differentiate the tonnage signals under normal and faulty conditions, we adopt the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to characterize the critical patterns in the RPs. A parameter learning algorithm is developed to set up the appropriate parameter of the RP method for progressive stamping processes. A real case study is provided to validate our approach, and the results are compared with the existing literature to demonstrate the outperformance of this proposed monitoring method.},

Dual eye tracking data for twenty two dyad teams were recorded during a laparoscopic task and then the teams were divided into good performer and poor performer teams based on the task times. Eventually we studied the de- lay between two team members for good and poor performer teams. The results indicated that the good performer teams show a smaller delay comparing to poor performer teams. This study is compatible with gaze overlap analysis between team members and therefore it is a good evidence of shared cognition between team members. 1.},

MER is a symbolic analysis approach for the detection of recurrence domains of complex dynamical systems from time series. Data were chosen from eight patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. MERs for interictal and ictal data were calculated and compared. A statistical test was performed to evaluate the ability of MER to separate the interictal state from the ictal state. MER showed significant changes from the interictal state into the ictal state, where MER was low at the ictal state and is significantly different with that at the interictal state. These suggest that MER is able to separate the ictal state from the interictal state based on ECoG data. It has the potential of detecting the transition between normal brain activity and the ictal state.},

Aims To investigate the dynamics of heart rate in young subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus through nonlinear and linear methods of heart rate variability. METHODS We evaluated 20 subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 23 healthy control subjects. We obtained the following nonlinear indices from the recurrence plot: recurrence rate (REC), determinism (DET), and Shanon entropy (ES), and we analysed indices in the frequency (LF and HF in ms2 and normalised units - nu - and LF/HF ratio) and time domains (SDNN and RMSSD), through analysis of 1000 R-R intervals, captured by a heart rate monitor. RESULTS There were reduced values (p{\textless}0.05) for individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus compared with healthy subjects in the following indices: DET, REC, ES, RMSSD, SDNN, LF (ms2), and HF (ms2). In relation to the recurrence plot, subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus demonstrated lower recurrence and greater variation in their plot, inter-group and intra-group, respectively. CONCLUSION Young subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus have autonomic nervous system behaviour that tends to randomness compared with healthy young subjects. Moreover, this behaviour is related to reduced sympathetic and parasympathetic activity of the autonomic nervous system.},

Cross-Recurrence Plot Quantification Analysis (CRQA) is an analysis method originally invented in theoretical physics and recently applied to cognitive science to study complex interpersonal coordination. In this paper, we adapted and extended this approach to analyzing joint activities in child-parent interaction. We developed and defined a new representation as Cross Recurrence Block based on CRQA. With this new representation, we were able to capture interpersonal dynamics from more than two behavioral streams in one Cross Recurrence Plot and derive a suite of measurements to quantify detailed characteristics of joint activities. Using a data set collected from child-parent interaction, we show that those quantitative measures of joint activities reveal developmental changes in coordination behavioral patterns between children and parents.},

abstract = {This research investigates the effects of flow pattern and salinity of oil-water two-phase flow on water holdup measurement using a conductance method. Firstly, vertical upward oil-water two-phase flow experiment is conducted in a 20 mm inner diameter (ID) pipe, in which the salinities of aqueous solutions are set as 151 ppm, 1003 ppm, 2494 ppm and 4991 ppm respectively. Experimental water-cut and mixture velocity are set as 80–100{\%} and 0.0184–0.2576 m/s. In the experiment, three different flow patterns, i.e., dispersed oil-in-water slug flow (D OS/W), dispersed oil-in-water flow (D O/W) and very fine dispersed oil-in-water flow (VFD O/W) are observed and recorded by a high speed camera. Meanwhile, we collect the response of Vertical Multiple Electrode Array (VMEA) conductance sensor excited by a sine voltage signal. The result shows that, for VFD O/W, the water holdup from VMEA sensor shows a satisfied agreement with that of quick closing valve (QCV) method under certain salinities, i.e., 1003 ppm as well as 2494 ppm. For D OS/W flow and D O/W flow characterized by dispersed oil droplets with various sizes, considerable deviations of water holdup between VMEA sensor and QCV method under four kinds of salinity aforementioned are presented. Afterward, according to experimental analysis along with theoretical deviation, it is concluded that the deviation of the measurement system reaches its minimum when reference resistance in the measurement circuit and salinity of the aqueous solution satisfy constraint conditions, and the accuracy of water holdup using the conductance method can be improved through adjusting reference resistance to match the salinity of water phase. Finally, the recurrence plot algorithm is utilized to identify typical flow patterns mentioned above and it shows satisfied results on comprehending the discrepancies among different flow patterns, demonstrating that the recurrence plot algorithm can be effectively applied in flow pattern identification regarding oil-water flows.},

modes of proteins. We use a Recurrence Plot based Wiener-Khinchin method
RPWK to calculate this spectrum, and the results are compared to those

method WK. The frequency spectra for the total nonbonded interaction
energy extracted from molecular dynamics simulations between the
-Lactamase Inhibitory Protein BLIP, and water molecules within a 10
angstrom distance from the protein surface, are calculated at 150, 200,

results shows that RPWK performs better than WK, and is able to detect
some frequency data points that WK fails to detect. This points to the
importance of using methods capable of taking the complex nature of the

standard linear methods. In general, RPWK can be a valuable addition to

Simulated signals are used to study the influence of the parameters of the cross recurrence plot, such as the embedding dimension, the similarity function, and the recurrence threshold, on the reliability and effectiveness of the estimator. Finally, the proposed method is validated on real underwater acoustic data, for which the cross recurrence plot estimates correctly 77.6 {\%} of the TDOAs, whereas the classical cross-correlation estimates correctly only 70.2 {\%} of the TDOAs.},

abstract = {Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is a well-known tool for studying nonlinear behavior of dynamical systems, e.g. for finding transitions in climate data or classifying reading abilities. But the construction of a recurrence plot and the subsequent quantification of its small and large scale structures is computational demanding, especially for long time series or data streams with high sample rate. One way to reduce the time and space complexity of RQA are approximations, which are sufficient for many data analysis tasks, although they do not guarantee exact solutions. In earlier work, we proposed how to approximate diagonal line based RQA measures and showed how these approximations perform in finding transitions for difference equations. The present work aims at extending these approximations to vertical line based RQA measures and investigating the runtime/accuracy of our approximate RQA measures on real-life climate data. Our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed approximate RQA measures achieve tremendous speedups without losing much of the accuracy.},

abstract = {This paper presents efficient low-power adaptive filter architecture for electroencephalogram (EEG) signal and epileptic seizure detection using recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). The preprocessing of EEG is done using notch, wavelet and adaptive filter. The comparison of signal-to-noise ratio of the filter outputs proves that the adaptive filter provides better performance and a parallel interleaved sample of direct form adaptive FIR filter architecture is implemented and low-power issues are addressed. An innovative compressor-based addition technique is utilized in the filter implementation to reduce the area and power consumption. The design is developed using Verilog HDL and mapped to 65-nm technological node. The power results are compared with conventional architecture of adaptive filter. The major advantage of choosing RQA is that it provides better information even for short non-stationary and nonlinear signals where other methods fail to provide good results. And it requires no conventions about data set size or dispersal of the data. The algorithm is applied on Circuits Syst Signal Process (2016) 35:2914–2931 2915 epileptic EEG signal from CHB-MIT database. The RQA measures are determined from the recurrence plot, its performance is measured in terms of sensitivity and speci-ficity as 97.4 and 93.5 {\%}, respectively, and leakage power is reduced to 10 {\%}.},

abstract = {Real-world data streams may change their behaviors along time, what is referred to as concept drift. By detecting those changes, researchers obtain relevant information about the phenomena that produced such streams (e.g. temperatures in a region, bacteria population, disease occurrence, etc.). Many concept drift detection algorithms consider supervised or semi-supervised approaches which tend to be unfeasible when data is collected at high frequencies, due to the difficulties involved in labeling. Complementarily, current studies usually assume data as statistically independent and identically distributed, disregarding any temporal relationship among observations and, consequently, risking the quality of data modeling. In order to tackle both aspects, we employ dynamical system modeling to represent the temporal relationships among data observations and how they modify along time in attempt to detect concept drift. This approach considers Taken's immersion theorem to unfold consecutive windows of data observations into the phase space in attempt to represent and compare time dependencies. From this perspective, we proposed four new concept drift detection algorithms based on the unsupervised machine learning paradigm. The first algorithm builds dendrograms of consecutive phase spaces (every phase space represents the time relationships for the observations contained in a particular data window) and compare them out by using the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, providing enough guarantees to detect concept drifts. The second algorithm employs the Cross Recurrence Plot and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis to detect relevant changes in consecutive phase spaces and warn about relevant data modifications. We also preprocess data windows by considering the Empirical Mode Decomposition method and Mutual Information in attempt to take only the deterministic stream behavior into account. All algorithms were implemented as plugins for the Massive Online Analysis (MOA) software and then compared to well-known algorithms from literature. Results confirm the proposed algorithms were capable of detecting most of the behavior changes, creating few false alarms.},

The vibration patterns included single-well oscillations and snap-through vibrations of both periodic and chaotic character; such vibration patterns led to a different power output. Classical spectral analysis of measured voltage, displacement and velocity time histories indicated the presence of a variety of nonlinear and chaotic phenomena. As a result, an analysis of the measured displacement and voltage time histories was carried out with the use of the Recurrence Plots and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis methods.

We propose to characterize these patients using a linear and a nonlinear methods, based on the spectral estimation and the recurrence plot, respectively. From BP signal, we extracted each systolic time interval (STI), upward systolic slope (BPsl), and the difference between systolic and diastolic BP, defined as pulse pressure (PP). After, the best subset of parameters were obtained through the sequential feature selection (SFS) method. According to the results, the best classification was obtained using a combination of linear and nonlinear features from STI and PP parameters. For STI, the best combination was obtained considering the frequency peak and the diagonal structures of RP, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 79{\%}. The same results were obtained when comparing PP values. Consequently, the use of combined linear and nonlinear parameters could improve the risk stratification of cardiomyopathy patients.},

We carry out experiments and measure the fluctuation signals from a rotating electric field conductance sensor with eight electrodes. We use recurrence plot and adaptive optimal kernel time–frequency representation to recognize different oil–water–gas three-phase flow patterns from experimental measurements. Then we employ multi-scale weighted complexity entropy causality plane (MS-WCECP) to explore the nonlinear characteristics for five typical oil–water–gas three-phase flow structures. The results suggest that our method enables to indicate flow pattern transitions. In particular, with the increase of scales, more information will be lost. Slug flow ends up in chaotic region, representing high complexity; Churn flow falls down from the chaotic to the random noise area, indicating the decreasing stability; while the drop degree of bubble flow is the biggest, suggesting that bubble flow has the most randomness. These findings demonstrate that multi-scale weighted complexity entropy causality plane can effectively depict the transitions of three-phase flow structures and serve as a useful tool for probing the nonlinear dynamics of the three-phase flows.},

The effectiveness of our measure is verified by applying different variables and noise levels. The results allow us to draw a number of conclusions concerning the proposed method.

abstract = {Background: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are among the greatest threats to childhood health globally. Epilepsy and autism are two of the most prevalent and debilitating NDDs. Importantly, these co-occur in approximately 30{\%} of children with a primary diagnosis of either disorder, suggesting a common brain pathology. Studies of NDDs have consistently shown that early intervention leads to better long-term outcomes. Yet, early intervention is predicated on early detection. Objective: We test the hypothesis that methods from complex dynamical systems theory based on multiscale recurrence plot analysis (mRPA) may be used to analyze short EEG measurements as reliable biomarkers for autism or absence epilepsy. Methods: Data from 92 children collected from a research lab and the Epilepsy Clinic at Boston Children's Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Nonlinear complexity measures were computed and machine learning algorithms were used in a cross-validation study to determine classification accuracy. Similarities and differences between autism and absence epilepsy were also found. Results: Classification algorithms were able to distinguish 3 groups (absence, ASD, control) with nearly 100{\%} accuracy. Important differences between absence epilepsy and autism groups may give insight into functional brain pathologies in these disorders, including possibly common neuropathologies and differences. Conclusion: Analysis of EEG signals with mRPA may provide a useful and urgently needed biomarker for early detection, monitoring developmental trajectories, predicting severity and potentially guiding early treatment of emerging epilepsy or autism in children. The finding that autism values were intermediate between epilepsy cases and controls suggests a common pathological continuum that is measureable.},

A visual and quantitative signal analytical procedure was put forward, which was the recurrence quantification analytical procedure. In this procedure, there were no specific requirements for the stationary characteristics of system and the procedure was not sensitive to noise. Firstly, the non stationary characteristics and other characteristics of the typical time series of hurricane Gustavo (2008) were obtained by utilizing phase space reconstruction techniques and recurrence plot theory. Thereafter, 6 recurrence quantification indexes were imported, which were recurrence rate, determinism, entropy, average diagonal line length, laminarity and trapping time and quantifies the signal characteristics of hurricane in the whole process of making landing, and defines one boundary for every index between hurricane signal and normal wind signal. Lastly, the procedure and all the indexes defined are verified by typhoon Muifa (1109). The result shows that the early hurricane has certain periodicity and stationarity; however, the non linearity and non stationary are particularly salient for the middle hurricane; 6 indexes can distinguish the signal characteristics between hurricane and normal wind; recurrence quantification analytical procedure completely suitable for the wind signal researches, and can fully describe the nonstationary characteristics of wind signals.},

abstract = {Plasma fireballs are generated due to a localized discharge and appear as a luminous glow with a sharp boundary, which suggests the presence of a localized electric field such as electrical sheath or double layer structure. The present work reports the observation of normal and inverse homoclinic bifurcation phenomena in plasma oscillations that are excited in the presence of fireball in a double plasma device. The controlling parameters for these observations are the ratio of target to source chamber (nT/nS) densities and applied electrode voltage. Homoclinic bifurcation is noticed in the plasma potential fluctuations as the system evolves from narrow to long time period oscillations and vice versa with the change of control parameter. The dynamical transition in plasma fireball is demonstrated by spectral analysis, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), and statistical measures, viz., skewness and kurtosis. The increasing trend of normalized variance reflects that enhancing nT/nS induces irregularity in plasma dynamics. The exponential growth of the time period is strongly indicative of homoclinic bifurcation in the system. The gradual decrease of skewness and increase of kurtosis with the increase of nT/nS also reflect growing complexity in the system. The visual change of recurrence plot and gradual enhancement of RQA variables DET, Lmax, and ENT reflects the bifurcation behavior in the dynamics. The combination of RQA and spectral analysis is a clear evidence that homoclinic bifurcation occurs due to the presence of plasma fireball with different density ratios. However, inverse bifurcation takes place due to the change of fireball voltage. Some of the features observed in the experiment are consistent with a model that describes the dynamics of ionization instabilities.},

abstract = {This paper shows the use of a specific type of time series analyses, the so named recurrence plot (RP), for investigations of the outer hull of an imaged and pre-segmented object to derive image features suitable for usage in classificators. Additionally to the features derived by the well documented recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) a new set of features was developed based on closed structures ("eyes") in a RP. The new features were named eye structure quantification (ESQ). Two sets of images are analysed: a) 1023 in-situ plankton images comprising nine different organism classes, and b) each 50 algorithmically created geometric shapes of five different classes. These images were characterised by standard image features, RQA quantification and the newly proposed features. A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was used to determine discriminative success between the classes of plankton organisms or geometric shapes respectively. The discriminative success was compared between a model using standard features and additional RQA and ESQ. For the high intra- and low interclass variance of the plankton contour line data set the included features enhanced discriminative success by 3 {\%} to a maximum of 65.8 {\%}. For the data set of geometric shapes an increase of 6.8 {\%} to 95.2 {\%} was observed. Although the overall increase of discriminative success was not extraordinary high by using a linear model, it can be seen that both RQA and ESQ are valuable auxiliary features to split specific classes from the entire population. Thus, they may also be valuable for methods mapping the finite dimensional feature space into higher dimensional spaces (e.g. Kernel trick, Support Vector Machines).},

The results show that: the pressure drop of bubble flow is maximum, followed by intermittent flow, and mist flow becomes the minimum. Based on the statistical analysis of the different pressure signals, the power spectrum density versus frequency of the signals for major flow patterns was obtained. It is found that the flow patterns can be identified in accordance with the power spectrum density. The recurrence quantification analysis method was used to study the dynamic characteristics of differential pressure fluctuating signals of bubbly flow, intermittent flow, mist flow patterns. The research indicated isolated points texture appeared on recurrence plot for the bubbly flow. Both dispersed points texture and massive texture appeared on recurrence plot for the intermittent flow with strong chaos characteristic. The recurrence plot of mist flow whose idicated periodic is outstanding has a good diagonal texture. The recursion texture of differential pressure fluctuating signals could well reflect the evolution characteristics of flow pattern, and the recurrence characteristics quantities were obvious to the variations of superficial gas velocity and provided a new idea for investigation of gas-liquid two-phase flow mechanism.},

In this study, we carry out experiments and measure the fluctuation signals from a rotating electric field conductance sensor with eight electrodes. We first use a recurrence plot to recognise flow patterns in vertical upward gas-liquid two-phase pipe flow from measured signals. Then we apply a multi-scale morphological analysis based on the first-order difference scatter plot to investigate the signals captured from the vertical upward gas-liquid two-phase flow loop test. We find that the invariant scaling exponent extracted from the multi-scale first-order difference scatter plot with the bisector of the second-fourth quadrant as the reference line is sensitive to the inhomogeneous distribution characteristics of the flow structure, and the variation trend of the exponent is helpful to understand the process of breakup and coalescence of the gas phase. In addition, we explore the dynamic mechanism influencing the inhomogeneous distribution of the gas phase in terms of adaptive optimal kernel time-frequency representation. The research indicates that the system energy is a factor influencing the distribution of the gas phase and the multi-scale morphological analysis based on the first-order difference scatter plot is an effective method for indicating the inhomogeneous distribution of the gas phase in gas-liquid two-phase flow.},

The implementation of chaotic time series prediction based on kernel functions is given and the training sample analysis proves it is better than the traditional prediction method.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rolling bearing faults often lead to electromechanical system failure due to its high speed and complex working conditions. Recently, a large amount of fault diagnosis studies for rolling bearing based on vibration data has been reported. However, few studies have focused on fault diagnosis for rolling bearings under variable conditions. This paper proposes a fault diagnosis method based on image recognition for rolling bearings to realize fault classification under variable working conditions. The proposed method includes the following steps. First, the vibration signal data are transformed into a two-dimensional image based on recurrence plot (RP) technique. Next, a popular feature extraction method which has been widely used in the image field, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), is employed to extract fault features from the two-dimensional RP and subsequently generate a 128-dimensional feature vector. Third, due to the redundancy of the high-dimensional feature, kernel principal component analysis is utilized to reduce the feature dimensionality. Finally, a neural network classifier trained by probabilistic neural network is used to perform fault diagnosis. Verification experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings under variable conditions, thereby providing a promising approach to fault diagnosis for rolling bearings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Cumulative recurrence plots are constructed for earthquakes recorded only in the areas of active dynamic influence of the specified faults. Special attention is paid to changes in slope angles of the recurrence plots at the transition to the area of strong magnitudes. It is noted that the right-side end of the plot (i.e. distribution tail) becomes steeper or less steep relative to the main distribution for small magnitudes. The degree of non-linearity and the forms of the recurrence plot tail are used to rank the faults of Central Asia by potential relative seismic hazard. It is shown that the highest seismic hazard is associated with the faults that control earthquakes with magnitudes M≥7.5, which recurrence plots show a trend to decrease the slope angle of the regression line in the area of strong magnitudes. It is highly probable that such earthquakes may reoccur in the fault zones in the next 50-100 years.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyse the temporal sequence of recovery events related to autonomic nervous system and metabolic processes following maximal exercise, applying linear and nonlinear indices of heart rate variability (HRV) and blood lactate concentration. METHODS: On the following day of the maximum oxygen consumption test, 20 participants firstly lay down for 20 min for resting data collection and then underwent the constant velocity exhaustive test, which consisted in running at 100{\%} of maximal velocity reached on the previous day until exhaustion. Immediately after the end of exercise, the participants kept a supine position for 120 min recovering passively. Prior to exercise and at every 10 min during the recovery time, blood samples were collected to determine lactate concentration, and heart rate variability analysis (time and frequency domain indices and recurrence plot variables) was performed. Friedman's test, complemented with Dunn's multiple comparison test, was used to compare recovery moments and baseline values. RESULTS: From 70 min, no significant differences were detected between lactate concentration and baseline. HRV indices were considered recovered at different timings: at 60 min for SD2; at 70 min for SDNN and LF; at 80 min for RMSSD, HF and SD1 and at 90 min for recurrence plot variables. CONCLUSIONS: During passive recovery after maximal exercise, restoration processes seem to comply an order, considering analysed HRV indices and lactate removal: at first, lactate concentration reaches normal values, allowing sympathovagal reorganization, and then, parasympathetic function is able to complete its reestablishment followed by system complexity recovering.},

For this purpose, pressure fluctuations of a fluidized bed of sand particle were measured at various gas velocities and temperatures. Recurrence quantification analysis showed that by increasing the temperature up to 300 °C, both determinism and laminarity increase due to formation of larger bubbles whereas entropy and recurrence rate decrease. To better detecting the different structures of in the bed recurrence plot at higher temperature, pressure fluctuations were also decomposed through wavelet transform. It was shown that at low gas velocity, the macro structures became dominate with increasing the bed temperature due to increase in the rate of bubble coalescence. The bubble diameter was estimated from the incoherent component of the cross power spectra of pressure signals at various temperatures and velocities. The incoherent results and standard deviation of measured pressure fluctuations confirmed that by increasing the bed temperature up to 300 °C, bubbles grow up to a maximum diameter, after which they became smaller. In addition, the trend of the largest positive Lyapunov exponent was estimated through the recurrence plot patterns.

abstract = {To accurately classify and identify different human gait signals, recurrence plot and recurrence quantification analysis are proposed to calculate the complexity of nonlinear time series underlying human gait stride interval. The appropriate delay time and embedding dimension are respectively calculated by methods of the mutual information and the false nearest neighbours. One dimension time series is extended to high dimension phase space by employing phase space reconstruction principle for studying the distribution regularity and movement characteristic of neighboring points in time series. The recurrence plots of gait signals from Parkinson's disease elders, healthy elders and youth are established for intuitively and qualitatively analyzing and evaluating their distribution state. It is observed that the space distribution of healthy subjects is more complex than others. Moreover, the complexity of human gait is quantified by recurrence quantification analysis. The computation results show that gait complexity of subjects with Parkinson's disease is less than healthy youth and elders, and independent sample t-test also exhibits their significant difference for distinct classification. Consequently, the proposed method is easy and feasible for classifying the subjects with different ages and Parkinson's disease. It is also helpful to human health monitoring and diagnosis.},

However, replicating these results across different types of accelerometers and their position on the body still remains a challenge. We introduce a new set of features in this domain based on recurrence plot and quantification analyses that are orientation invariant and able to capture non-linear dynamics of SMM. Applying these features to an existing published data set containing acceleration data, we achieve up to 9$\backslash${\%} average increase in accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art published results.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} T{\"{U}}BİTAK. In this paper we present a method to predict sudden cardiac death (SCD) based on the heart rate variability (HRV) signal and recurrence plots and Poincar{\'{e}} plot-extracted features. This work is a challenge since it is aimed to devise a method to predict SCD 5 min before its onset. The method consists of four steps: preprocessing, feature extraction, feature reduction, and classification. In the first step, the QRS complexes are detected from the electrocardiogram signal and then the HRV signal is extracted. In the second step, the recurrence plot of the HRV signal and Poincar{\'{e}} plot-extracted features are obtained. Four features from the recurrence plot and three features from the Poincar{\'{e}} plot are extracted. The features are recurrence rate, determinism, entropy and averaged diagonal line length, and SD1, SD2, and SD1/SD2. In the next step, these features are reduced to one feature by the linear discriminant analysis technique. Finally, K-nearest neighbor and support vector machine-based classifiers are used to classify the HRV signals. We use two databases, the MIT/BIH Sudden Cardiac Death Database and PhysioBank Normal Sinus Rhythm Database. We manage to predict SCD occurrence 5 min before the SCD with accuracy of over 92{\%}.},

Personal discourse has a two-scaled geometry with smaller within-context dimensionalities than between-context dimensionalities. Prior studies have shown that reading experience (Doxas, Dennis, {\&} Oliver, 2010) and visual experience (Sreekumar, Dennis, Doxas, Zhuang, {\&} Belkin, 2014) have a similar two-scaled structure.

abstract = {To make valid inferences from recurrence plots for time-delay embedded signals, two underlying key questions are: (1) to what extent does an unthresholded recurrence (URP) plot carry the same information as the signal that generated it, and (2) how does the information change when the URP gets distorted. We studied the first question in our earlier work [1], where it was shown that the URP admits the reconstruction of the underlying signal (up to its mean and a choice of sign) if and only if an associated graph is connected. Here we refine this result and we give an explicit condition in terms of the embedding parameters and the discrete Fourier spectrum of the URP. We also develop a method for the reconstruction of the underlying signal which overcomes several drawbacks that earlier approaches had. To address the second question we investigate robustness of the proposed reconstruction method under disturbances. We carry out two simulation experiments which are characterized by a broad band and a narrow band spectrum respectively. For each experiment we choose a noise level and two different pairs of embedding parameters. The conventional binary recurrence plot (RP) is obtained from the URP by thresholding and zero-one conversion, which can be viewed as severe distortion acting on the URP. Typically the reconstruction of the underlying signal from an RP is expected to be rather inaccurate. However, by introducing the concept of a multi-level recurrence plot (MRP) we propose to bridge the information gap between the URP and the RP, while still achieving a high data compression rate. We demonstrate the working of the proposed reconstruction procedure on MRPs, indicating that MRPs with just a few discretization levels can usually capture signal properties and morphologies more accurately than conventional RPs.},

Its application spans the analysis of trabecular bone structures, Turing patterns, turbulent spatial plankton patterns, and fractals. Determinism is a central measure in this framework quantifying the level of regularity of spatial structures. We show by basic examples of fully regular patterns of different symmetries that this measure underestimates the orderliness of circular patterns resulting from rotational symmetries. We overcome this crucial problem by checking additional structural elements of the generalized recurrence plot which is demonstrated with the examples. Furthermore, we show the potential of the extended quantity of determinism applying it to more irregular circular patterns which are generated by the complex Ginzburg-Landau-equation and which can be often observed in real spatially extended dynamical systems. So, we are able to reconstruct the main separations of the system's parameter space analyzing single snapshots of the real part only, in contrast to the use of the original quantity.

The increasing availability of highly resolved spatio-temporal data leads to new opportunities as well as challenges in many scientific disciplines such as climatology, ecology or epidemiology. This allows more detailed insights into the investigated spatially extended systems. However, this development needs advanced techniques of data analysis which go beyond standard linear tools since the more precise consideration often reveals nonlinear phenomena, for example threshold effects. One of these tools is the recurrence plot approach which has been successfully applied to the description of complex systems. Using this technique's power of visualization, we propose the analysis of the local minima of the underlying distance matrix in order to display driving forces of spatially extended systems. The potential of this novel idea is demonstrated by the analysis of the chlorophyll concentration and the sea surface temperature in the Southern California Bight. We are able not only to confirm the influence of El Ni{\~{n}}o events on the phytoplankton growth in this region but also to confirm two discussed regime shifts in the California current system. This new finding underlines the power of the proposed approach and promises new insights into other complex systems.},

One of the successful approaches to detect direct coupling in the information theory framework is transfer entropy. However, the core of entropy-based tools lies on the probability estimation of the underlying variables. Here we propose a data-driven approach for causality inference that incorporates recurrence plot features into the framework of information theory. We define it as the recurrence measure of conditional dependence (RMCD), and we present some applications. The RMCD quantifies the causal dependence between two processes based on joint recurrence patterns between the past of the possible driver and present of the potentially driven, excepting the contribution of the contemporaneous past of the driven variable. Finally, it can unveil the time scale of the influence of the sea-surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean on the precipitation in the Amazonia during recent major droughts.},

Two concrete series with two types of cement with different C3A content and similar mechanical properties were subjected to external sulphate attack (ESA) and evaluated using a novel Recurrence Plot Quantification Analysis (RQA) method. This brand new technique was compared with several methods, such as mechanical tests (compressive and flexural strength determination), dynamic test (dynamic modulus) measurements, and traditional ultrasonic measurements (propagation velocity and ultrasonic wave attenuation). In these experiments, RQA showed a high sensitivity to damage in spoiled series, improving the reliability of damage detection with ultrasonics in non-homogeneous materials compared to other non-destructive techniques. Interesting advantages of this new non-destructive technique are: a) the RQA parameter is normalized (range of 0 to 1); b) a calibration process is not required; c) the values of its standard deviation show the dispersion of the damage. It can contribute greatly to the diagnosis of the degree of damage to a material, when combined with other traditional measures such as the attenuation of the material.},

Pressure fluctuations were measured in a lab scale fluidized bed of various particle sizes at different gas velocities. First, the CRQA was applied to a number of well-known dynamic systems and the results demonstrated that it is a powerful method to detect similarities between nonlinear signals. Then, it was shown that graphical structures within the cross recurrence plot of pressure fluctuations of a fluidized bed vary with both superficial gas velocity and particle size. It was found that determinism and cross recurrence rate of non-normalized data initially decrease and then increase with increasing the gas velocity. When the signal is initially normalized, determinism and entropy do not change with the superficial gas velocity while cross recurrence rate is sensible to changes in the superficial gas velocity. It was concluded that entropy can be used for detecting changes of particle size and if a proper reference state is chosen, entropy can be a powerful index for detecting changes in the size of particles in a fluidized bed.},

Air pressure and liquid flow inside the nozzle are simultaneously recorded using a data acquisition system and a high speed camera. The recurrence plot and cross recurrence plot methods are used to identify the loss of synchronization between air pressure fluctuations and the depth of liquid flow inside the nozzle during chaotic bubble departures. We claim that the synchronization between pressure fluctuations and the depth of liquid penetration inside the nozzle is suppressed during chaotic bubble departures. The experimental results show agreement with the numerical findings. The results demonstrate that the non-linearities of processes occurring during liquid penetration inside the nozzle have a significant impact on the synchronization between the time histories of pressure and the corresponding depths of liquid penetration inside the nozzle.},

Based on the cumulative intrinsic mode functions extracted by the EMD, the frequency-evolving RP regarding different oscillation of modes suggests that apparent dynamics of the data considered are mainly dominated by its components of medium- and low-frequencies while severely affected by fast oscillated noises contained in the signal. Noises are then eliminated to analyze the intrinsic dynamics and consequently, the denoised time-evolving RQA diversely characterizes the properties of the signal and marks crucial points more accurately where white bands in the RP occur, whereas a strongly qualitative agreement exists between all the non-denoised RQA measures. Generally, the EMD combining with the recurrence analysis sheds more reliable, abundant and inherent lights into the traffic flow, which is meaningful to the empirical analysis of complex systems.},

The growing volume of theoretical knowledge about systems dynamic's offered researchers the opportunity to look for non-linear dynamics in data whose evolution linear models are unable to explain in a satisfactory manner. One of the most recent approach in this respect is Recurrence Analysis - RA. It is a graphical method designed to locate hidden recurring patterns, nonstationarity and structural changes. RA approach have first been applied in natural sciences like physics and biology. Quickly, was adopted in economics and engineering. Meanwhile, the fast development of computer resources has provided powerful tools to perform this new and complex model. One free software which we used to perform the analysis is Visual Recurrence Analysis - VRA developed by Eugene Kononov. As is presented in this paper, the recurrence plot investigation for the analyzing of the gasoline engine shows some of the its capabilities in this domain. We chose two specific engine parameters measured in two different tests to perform the RPA. These parameters are ignition angle and engine angular speed. There were computed graphs for each of them. Graphs were analyzed and compared to obtain a conclusion. This work is an incipient research, being one of the first attempt of using recurrence plot for analyzing automotive dynamics.

To this end, we propose a new method for reconstructing time series from the networks. We compare the reconstructed time series from these networks and that from the recurrence plot. We find that these networks contain topological information of the embedded time series to a certain degree. In general, they are more powerful than the recurrence plot method in the reconstruction of embedded time series. In addition, we study a new generalized projective synchronization (GPS) of coupled complex dynamical networks with different sizes via feedback control and impulsive control. Based on the stability analysis of impulsive system, a network synchronization criterion is established. These works may find potential application for secure communication via networks.},

However, few studies have focused on fault diagnosis for rolling bearings under variable conditions. This paper introduces a fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings under variable conditions based on visual cognition. The proposed method includes the following steps. First, the vibration signal data are transformed into a recurrence plot (RP), which is a two-dimensional image. Then, inspired by the visual invariance characteristic of the human visual system (HVS), we utilize speed up robust feature to extract fault features from the two-dimensional RP and generate a 64-dimensional feature vector, which is invariant to image translation, rotation, scaling variation, etc. Third, based on the manifold perception characteristic of HVS, isometric mapping, a manifold learning method that can reflect the intrinsic manifold embedded in the high-dimensional space, is employed to obtain a low-dimensional feature vector. Finally, a classical classification method, support vector machine, is utilized to realize fault diagnosis. Verification data were collected from Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center, and the experimental result indicates that the proposed fault diagnosis method based on visual cognition is highly effective for rolling bearings under variable conditions, thus providing a promising approach from the cognitive computing field.},

In this paper, we presented a new machine learning method for CIT in which each subject is considered independent of the others. The main goal of this study is to adapt the discriminative sparse models to be applicable for subject-based concealed information test. Methods In order to provide sufficient discriminability between guilty and innocent subjects, we introduced a novel discriminative sparse representation model and its appropriate learning methods. For evaluation of the method forty-four subjects participated in a mock crime scenario and their EEG data were recorded. As the model input, in this study the recurrence plot features were extracted from single trial data of different stimuli. Then the extracted feature vectors were reduced using statistical dependency method. The reduced feature vector went through the proposed subject-based sparse model in which the discrimination power of sparse code and reconstruction error were applied simultaneously. Results Experimental results showed that the proposed approach achieved better performance than other competing discriminative sparse models. The classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the presented sparsity-based method were about 93{\%}, 91{\%} and 95{\%} respectively. Conclusions Using the EEG data of a single subject in response to different stimuli types and with the aid of the proposed discriminative sparse representation model, one can distinguish guilty subjects from innocent ones. Indeed, this property eliminates the necessity of several subject EEG data in model learning and decision making for a specific subject.},

abstract = {One of the severest perturbations of the Silurian marine environment is the mid-Homerian Mulde bioevent. This event proceeded in several temporal steps, which, according to some authors, implies possible globally synchronous perturbation. The dynamic pace and consequences of these perturbations, as well as their effects on conodont community dynamics, are largely unknown. Here I used so-called recurrence and cross recurrence plots to test the hypothesis of common forcing of the Mulde event on conodont abundance dynamics at the regional scale. The results of the analysis of two Lithuanian sections from the Baltic basin revealed that in the uppermost part of the lundgreni graptolite biozone there was sharp transition in the recurrence patterns. Pre-Mulde Homerian time was characterized by high-amplitude fluctuations and a low recurrence rate. On the other hand, the Mulde interval state was characterized by low abundance and a high recurrence rate with longer horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines of the recurrence plot, which implies transition to a more ordered (irregularly periodic), stable (laminar) dynamical state. The cross recurrence plot analyses of Lithuanian and Polish core data show a close coherence of this pattern at the regional scale, which is expected for widespread critical transition in ecosystem structure. Additionally, with appropriate regression techniques, cross recurrence plots of conodont abundance allow correlation of sections without prior input from other kinds of stratigraphical information. This shows the potential of conodont abundance as a potent tool in revealing the effects of the Mulde event at the regional scale and coherent dynamical patterns of recurrence that can inform stratigraphic correlation.},

Finite nonlinear interaction obtained from phase coherence index values is observed to be predominant at a particular amplitude of square forcing which corroborates our nonlinearity analysis using DVV. Existence of phase coherence index has been demonstrated introducing continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Characterization of the difference in the phase distribution by the difference in the waveform in real space instead of dealing in Fourier space has been facilitated by introducing structure function or path length for different orders to study and identify the dynamical system. The expression of path length eventually enables us to evaluate the phase coherence index.

abstract = {In nonlinear dynamical systems the determination of stable and unstable periodic orbits as part of phase space prediction is problematic in particular if perturbed by noise. Fourier spectra of the time series or its autocorrelation function have shown to be of little use if the dynamic process is not strictly wide-sense stationary or if it is nonlinear. To locate unstable periodic orbits of a chaotic attractor in phase space the least stable eigenvalue can be determined by approximating locally the trajectory via linearisation. This approximation can be achieved by employing a Gaussian kernel estimator and minimising the summed up distances of the measured time series i.e. its estimated trajectory (e.g. via Levenberg-Marquardt). Noise poses a significant problem here. The application of the Wiener-Khinchin theorem to the time series in combination with recurrence plots, i.e. the Fourier transform of the recurrence times or rates, has been shown capable of detecting higher order dynamics (period-2 or period-3 orbits), which can fail using classical FouRiER-based methods. However little is known about its parameter sensitivity, e.g. with respect to the time delay, the embedding dimension or perturbations. Here we provide preliminary results on the application of the recurrence time spectrum by analysing the H{\'{e}}non and the R{\"{o}}ssler attractor. Results indicate that the combination of recurrence time spectra with a nonlinearly filtered plot of return times is able to estimate the unstable periodic orbits. Owing to the use of recurrence plot based measures the analysis is more robust against noise than the conventional Fourier transform.},

One of the key parameters in analyzing climate change is to analyze temperature variations in different regions. The temperature variation in a region is periodic within the interval. Temperature variations, though periodic in nature, may vary from one region to another and such variations are mainly dependent on the location and altitude of the region and also on other factors like the nearness of sea and vegetation. In this paper, we analyze such periodic variations using recurrence plot (RP), cross recurrence plot (CRP), recurrence rate (RR), and correlation of probability of recurrence (CPR) methods to find similarities of periodic variations between and within climatic regions and to identify their connectivity trend.

The consequences of wrong decisions that happen in our daily life might be unembellished. However, wrong decisions in healthcare based on unreliable evidence due to erroneous software could result in loss of life. Dysphonic patients suffering from various vocal fold disorders might have a threat of life due to inaccurate diagnosis. Some voice disorders, such as keratosis, are precancerous, and can become cancerous in cases that involve inaccurate diagnosis due to software failure. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a healthcare software for the detection of voice disorders in nonperiodic speech signals. Occurrences of potential risks during the design and development of the proposed software are taken into account to avoid failure. The software is implemented by applying the local binary pattern (LBP) operator on the textures of nonperiodic signals. The textures are obtained through the recurrence plot. The LBP operator computes the histograms for normal persons and dysphonic patients, and these histograms are used with the support vector machine for the automatic classification of dysphonic patients. The software is evaluated and tested by using the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary voice disorder database. The success rate of the proposed healthcare system is 97.73{\%} {\&}plusmn; 1.2, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.98 {\&}plusmn; 0.

It is worth noting that we also study active but non-HILDCAA intervals. Examining the geomagnetic AE index, we apply a dynamics analy-sis composed of the phase space, the recurrence plot (RP), and the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) methods. As a result, the quantification finds two distinct clusterings of the dynamical behaviours occurring in the interplane-tary medium: one regarding a geomagnetically quiet condi-tion regime and the other regarding an interplanetary activ-ity regime. Furthermore, the HILDCAAs seem unique events regarding a visible, intense manifestations of interplanetary Alfv{\'{e}}nic waves; however, they are similar to the other kinds of conditions regarding a dynamical signature (based on RQA), because it is involved in the same complex mecha-nism of generating geomagnetic disturbances. Also, by char-acterizing the proper conditions of transitions from quies-cent conditions to weaker geomagnetic disturbances inside the magnetosphere and ionosphere system, the RQA method indicates clearly the two fundamental dynamics (geomagnet-ically quiet intervals and HILDCAA events) to be evaluated with magneto-hydrodynamics simulations to understand bet-ter the critical processes related to energy and particle trans-fer into the magnetosphere–ionosphere system.

abstract = {Experimental evidence of different kinds of oscillations in floating potential fluctuations of glow discharge magnetized plasma is being reported. A spherical gridded cage is inserted into the ambient plasma volume for creating plasma bubbles. Plasma is produced between a spherical mesh grid and chamber. The spherical mesh grid of 80{\%} optical transparency is connected to the positive terminal of power supply and considered as anode. Two Langmuir probes are kept in the ambient plasma to measure the floating potential fluctuations in different positions within the system, viz., inside and outside the spherical mesh grid. At certain conditions of discharge voltage (Vd) and magnetic field, irregular to regular mode appears, and it shows chronological changes with respect to magnetic field. Further various nonlinear analyses such as Recurrence Plot, Hurst exponent, and Lyapunov exponent have been carried out to investigate the dynamics of oscillation at a range of discharge voltages and external magnetic fields. Determinism, entropy, and Lmax are important measures of Recurrence Quantification Analysis which indicate an irregular to regular transition in the dynamics of the fluctuations. Furthermore, behavior of the plasma oscillation is characterized by the technique called multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to explore the nature of the fluctuations. It reveals that it has a multifractal nature and behaves as a long range correlated process.},

In this approach, a synthetic database of images representing normalized shear stress distributions is formed from a training data set using recurrence plot (RP) analysis. The face recognition algorithm is then employed to synthesize the RPs and transform the original database into short-dimension vectors containing similarity weights proportional to the principal components of the distribution of images. These vectors capture the intrinsic properties of the boundary shear stress distribution of the cases in the training set, and are sensitive to variations of the corresponding hydraulic parameters. The process of transforming one-dimensional data series into vectors of weights is invertible, and therefore, shear stress distributions for unseen cases can be predicted. The developed method is applied to predict boundary shear stress distributions in smooth trapezoidal and circular channels and the results show a cross correlation coefficient above 92{\%}, mean square errors within 0.04{\%} and 4.48{\%}, respectively, and average shear stress fluctuations within 2{\%} and 5{\%}, respectively, thus indicating that the proposed method is capable of providing accurate estimations of the boundary shear stress distribution in open channels.},

Phase recurrence analysis and long-range persistence are the two dynamical structures of the underlying processes for the given natural phenomenon. Linear and nonlinear time series analysis approaches (cross-correlation analysis, cross-recurrence plot, wavelet coherent transform, and Hurst analysis) are combined to investigate the relative phase interconnection and long-range correlation between solar activity and geomagnetic activity for the time interval from 1932 January to 2017 January. The following prominent results are found: (1) geomagnetic activity lags behind sunspot numbers with a phase shift of 21 months, and they have a high level of asynchronous behavior; (2) their relative phase interconnections are in phase for the periodic scales during 8-16 years, but have a mixing behavior for the periodic belts below 8 years; (3) both sunspot numbers and geomagnetic activity can not be regarded as a stochastic phenomenon because their dynamical behaviors display a long-term correlation and a fractal nature. We believe that the presented conclusions could provide further information on understanding the dynamical coupling of solar dynamo process with geomagnetic activity variation, and the crucial role of solar and geomagnetic activity in the long-term climate change.},

The RR tachograms were collected from patients in the supine position for about 20 minutes.

RESULTS: Quantitative and qualitative signs of heart rate variability recovery were observed after transplantation.

abstract = {Action shooting competitions (ACS) of the International Pistol Shooting Confederation are a worldwide sports activity consisting in stages needing awareness, quick decision-making and tactics to manage simultaneous bursts of psychological and physical stress. Cardiovascular load can be unexpectedly higher and cardiac autonomic response (CAR) different if compared to academic shooting. High anxiety and low management of emotions can reduce the performance and the ability to be accurate in such complex shooting task. Aim: To evaluate CAR during shooting simulator training (SST) and during ASC. To correlate individual performance score with the level of anxiety and with Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters. Methods: 3-lead ECG of 30 athletes was continuously monitored before, during and after training at SST with programmable degrees of skill requirements and during ASC. Anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait (STAI), before and after shooting tasks. HRV parameters were computed from short-term (120-seconds) intervals, in the time-domain (TD), frequency-domain (FD) and with non-linear (NL) methods [Poincar{\`{e}} plot (PP), Recurrence plot (RP), Detrended fluctuation analysis (DF), Approximate entropy (AE), Sample entropy (SE), Correlation dimension (CD)]. Time-varying spectral analysis was used to visualize transient fluctuations (Figure 1A) of FD components. LF/HF ratio was accepted as an index of different CAR induce by SST and ASC (Figure 1B). Discriminant Analysis (DA) was applied to HRV parameters to differentiate SST- and ASC- induced stress (Figure 1C). Results: All athletes were in good psychological balance, with no evidence of individual tendency to respond with abnormal levels of state anxiety to the test challenges. Sympatho-vagal modulation was different during SST and ASC (Figure 1B). At univariate analysis, most NL parameters, SDNN/RMSSD and LF/HF ratio were significantly different (p{\textless}0.05) between SST and ASC. By combining short-term TD HRVtri, and NL PPsd1/sd2, RPrec and DFalfa1 in the formulas: [F1 = 9.68 x sd1/sd2 - 0.2 x HRVtri + 0.12 x RPrec - 1.6 x DFalfa1 - 4.82] and [F2 = 10.7 x sd1/sd2 + 0.48 x HRVtri + 0.04 x RPrec + 1.56 x DFalfa1 - 10.1], DA differentiated rest from stress induced by SST and by ASC with 91.8{\%} predictive accuracy (PA). The two stress conditions were separated with 97{\%} PA, with F1= 8.9 x sd1/sd2 - 0.2 x HRVtri + 0.1 x RPrec - 1.03 x DFalfa1 - 5.8 (ASC if F1 {\textgreater}1). Higher task-related anxiety was correlated with lower shooting accuracy during both TTS and ASC. Conclusions: DA of HRV parameters is efficient in differentiating stress induced by SST and ASC. ASC is unrivalled to test individual capability to manage strong emotional reactions in competition. SST, although less demanding, provides objective correlation between tasks difficulty and performance, allows precise storage of scores and is helpful to design individualized training methods for the competitive shooter.

This induced noise is known to cause disrupted and deviated diagonal lines despite the known deterministic features and, hence, biases the diagonal line based RQA measures and can lead to misleading conclusions. Although discontinuous lines can be further connected by increasing the recurrence threshold, such an approach triggers thick lines in the plot. However, thick lines also influence the RQA measures by artificially increasing the number of diagonals and the length of vertical lines [e.g., Determinism ( D E T) and Laminarity ( L A M) become artificially higher]. To take on this challenge, an extended RQA approach for accounting disrupted and deviated diagonal lines is proposed.

However, such a simplified parameterization brings about some notable changes in the appearance of the obtained Recurrence Plots, which has consequences for the extraction of the standard dynamical measures. Specifically, a categorical Recurrence Plot is often composed of rectangular structures rather than line structures (diagonal and horizontal/vertical), over which the recurrence quantification measures were originally proposed. Starting from this observation, I consider alternative computational procedures to extract a non-biased measure of entropy for the categorical case, showing the viability of such a choice with simulated data},

Under the presented experimental circumstances, intermittent trailing-edge vortex shedding occurs. A flow diagnostic analysis combining the proper orthogonal decomposition method with a recurrence plot and quantification analysis reveals that the occurrence and duration of vortex-shedding interruptions are random and that the durations of the interruptions are shorter than the intervals of regular shedding. Furthermore, a recurrence-based conditional averaging strategy is proposed that preserves the instantaneous dynamics of the wake flow and allows for successful separation of the coherent and turbulent contributions to the flowfield fluctuations. Based on the recurrence-based conditional averaged flowfields, the spatiotemporal evolution of the wake centerline is visualized and the wake convection speed is calculated. The latter is found to be distributed normally around 0.66 of the freestream velocity.

The dynamics of the Dst signals behave in stochastic path during the minor geomagnetic stormy period and in deterministic path during increasing geomagnetic stormy period. As the geomagnetic storm increases, the RP showed more deterministic structure indicating that it possesses the potential to detect geomagnetic storm event even at the infinitesimal impact of the geomagnetic storm. The dynamical behaviour is reflected in the RR as the geomagnetic storm intensifies. The occurrence of geomagnetic storm associated with significant Dst signal and monthly average RR is prevalent during the beginning year (2012) of the high solar activity than the peak year (2014) of the high solar activity. Our results show that higher average RR is not consistent throughout the equinoctial season between the year 2008 and 2016.},

abstract = {The hydrodynamics of airlift pumps at various gas superficial velocities were investigated using the wavelet packet transform and recurrence plot due to their capabilities for extracting the micro structures and determining the whole complexity in airlift pumps. For this purpose, the pressure fluctuations of an airlift pump were measured at various gas superficial velocities. The wavelet packet transform was first used to extract the integer approximation and detailed information from the pressure signals. Then, the energy distributions in each frequency band were calculated and the corresponding dynamical characteristics were obtained using a recurrence plot. It was found that the highest pumping efficiency under the slug-churn flow condition is caused by the highest mean pressure. In addition, the energy of the slug-churn flow regime has a dramatic increase in the frequency band of 31.25–62.5 Hz, due to the burst of big Taylor bubbles. In the low-frequency band (0–31.25 Hz), the pressure shows a chaotic behavior due to the turbulence of liquid flow. In the frequency band of 31.25–62.5 Hz, the pressure executes a transition from chaotic fluctuation in slug flow to periodic fluctuation in slug-churn due to the linear motion of small bubbles.},

A total of 20 healthy volunteers performed two physical workouts lasting 5 (P5) and 10 min (P10). In both workouts, volunteers performed as many repetitions as possible within the time limit of sets of 10 repetitions of four different exercises in the order of pull-ups, push-ups, barbell power clean, and barbell shoulder to overhead press. Barbell exercises were performed using a load of 50{\%} of each volunteer's personal record for the jerk lift. Successive RR intervals were recorded 1 h before, immediately after, and 1 h after each workout. HAC parameters were obtained using linear (e.g., time- and frequency-domain analysis) and nonlinear [e.g., recurrence plot (RP)] methods. The number of repetitions was recorded during each workout, and the cadence (e.g., repetitions per minute) was calculated. All HAC parameters showed a significant main effect with time; however, only some RP parameters (e.g., recurrence rate (REC), maximal length of lines (Lmax), and Shannon entropy) were significantly greater in P5. The number of repetitions was significantly greater in P10, but the cadence was higher in P5. Both workouts induced an acute increase in sympathetic activity and vagal withdrawal; however, P5 exhibited greater REC and Lmax, indicating a greater vagal withdrawal. This could be explained by a more intense performance in P5, as evidenced by the greater cadence. In addition, only the RP parameters (a nonlinear approach) were more suitable to detect acute exercise-induced changes in HAC.},

The transition in the dynamics is observed through recurrence plot techniques which is an efficient method to observe the critical regime transitions in dynamics. The complexity of the nonlinear fluctuation has been revealed with the help of recurrence quantification analysis which is a suitable tool for investigating recurrence, an ubiquitous feature providing a deep insight into the dynamics of real dynamical system. An informal test for stationarity which checks for the compatibility of nonlinear approximations to the dynamics made in different segments in a time series has been proposed. In case of sinusoidal, noise, square forcing applied on fluctuation acquired at P = 0.12 mbar only one dominant scaling region is observed whereas the forcing applied on fluctuation (P = 0.04 mbar) two prominent scaling regions have been explored reliably using different forcing amplitudes indicating the signature of crossover phenomena. Furthermore a persistence long range behavior has been observed in one of these scaling regions. A comprehensive study of the quantification of scaling exponents has been carried out with the increase in amplitude and frequency of sinusoidal, square type of forcings. The scalings exponent is envisaged to be the roughness of the time series. The method provides a single quantitative idea of the scaling exponent to quantify the correlation properties of a signal.},

Sample entropy is a popular measure for quantifying signal irregularity. However, the sample entropy does not take sequential information, which is inherently useful, into its calculation of sample similarity. Here, we develop a method that is based on the mathematical principle of the sample entropy and enables the capture of sequential information of a time series in the context of spatial dependence provided by the binary-level co-occurrence matrix of a recurrence plot. Experimental results on time-series data of the Lorenz system, physiological signals of gait maturation in healthy children, and gait dynamics in Huntington's disease show the potential of the proposed method.},

This method significantly reduces spatial complexity of computation by computing RQA directly from the time series, optimizing memory accesses and reducing computational time. Additionally, parallel implementation of this technique is tested on the Salomon cluster and is proved to be extremely fast and scalable.

The behavior of these two measures as a function of the fGn's Hurst exponent H is investigated. We show that the dependence of the laminarity with respect to H is monotonic in contrast to the percent determinism. We also show that the length of the diagonal and vertical lines involved in the computation of percent determinism and laminarity has an influence on their dependence on H. Statistical tests performed on the L A M measure support its utility to discriminate fGn processes with respect to their H values.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Most  previous studies have focused on major depression, and studies on subclinical depression, such as those on so-called dysphoria, have been overlooked. Indeed, dysphoria is associated with a high prevalence of somatic disorders, and a reduction of quality of life and life expectancy. In current clinical practice, dysphoria is assessed using psychometric questionnaires and structured interviews only, without taking into account objective pathophysiological indices. To address this problem, in this study we investigated heartbeat linear and nonlinear dynamics to derive objective autonomic nervous system biomarkers of dysphoria. APPROACH: Sixty undergraduate students participated in the study: according to clinical evaluation, 24 of them were dysphoric. Extensive group-wise statistics was performed to characterize the pathological and control groups. Moreover, a recursive feature elimination algorithm based on a K-NN classifier was carried out for the automatic recognition of dysphoria at a single-subject level. MAIN RESULTS: The results showed that the most significant group-wise differences referred to increased heartbeat complexity (particularly for fractal dimension, sample entropy and recurrence plot analysis) with regards to the healthy controls, confirming dysfunctional nonlinear sympatho-vagal dynamics in mood disorders. Furthermore, a balanced accuracy of 79.17{\%} was achieved in automatically distinguishing dysphoric patients from controls, with the most informative power attributed to nonlinear, spectral and polyspectral quantifiers of cardiovascular variability. SIGNIFICANCE: This study experimentally supports the assessment of dysphoria as a defined clinical condition with specific characteristics which are different both from healthy, fully euthymic controls and from full-blown major depression.},

abstract = {Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a prevalent sleep disorder, and highly affects the quality of human life. Currently, gold standard for OSA detection is Polysomnogram. Since this method is time consuming and cost inefficient, practical systems focus on the usage of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for OSA detection. In this paper, a novel automatic OSA detection method using a single-lead ECG signal has been proposed. A non-linear feature extraction using Wavelet Transform (WT) coefficients obtained by an ECG signal decomposition is employed. In addition, different classification methods are investigated. ECG signals are decomposed into 8 levels using a Symlet function as a mother Wavelet function with third-order. Then, the entropy-based features including fuzzy/approximate/sample/correct conditional entropy as well as other non-linear features including interquartile range, mean absolute deviation, variance, Poincare plot and recurrence plot are extracted from WT coefficients. The best features are chosen using the automatic sequential forward feature selection algorithm. In order to assess the introduced method, 95 single-lead ECG recordings are used. SVM classifier having a RBF kernel leads to an accuracy of 94.63{\%} (Sens: 94.43{\%}, Spec: 94.77{\%}) and 95.71{\%} (Sens: 95.83{\%}, Spec: 95.66{\%}) for minute-by-minute and subject-by-subject classifications, respectively. The results show that applying entropy-based features for extracting hidden information of the ECG signals outperforms other available automatic OSA detection methods. The results indicate that a highly accurate OSA detection is attained by just exploiting the single-lead ECG signals. Furthermore, due to the low computational load in the proposed method, it can easily be applied to the home monitoring systems. IEEE},

abstract = {Insights into the temporal-spatial characteristics of air traffic flow is the prerequisite of air traffic flow modeling, prediction and optimization. The intrinsic dynamics of air traffic flow were analyzed according to radar track data by classical nonlinear analysis and complex network methods. The nonlinear dynamic characteristics of air traffic flow were revealed from multiple perspectives by means of phase space reconstruction, recurrence plot, Lyapunov exponent, correlation dimension and Hurst exponent. The experimental results show that the example traffic flow became the most chaotic and the state persistence was poorest at time scale of 30 min. Besides, this paper explored the application of a complex network to analyze the nonlinearity of air traffic flow, and verified the chaotic and fractal characteristics by analyzing the degree distribution of the converted network. The degree distribution of the network derived from the traffic flow time series was approximately fitted to the exponential function and featured a strength level of chaos that was positively correlated with the size of network degree distribution power exponent. The linear relationship between network degree distribution power exponent and Hurst exponent was revealed, and the nonlinearity of air route traffic flow was systematically characterized. Particularly, the complex network-based analysis method helped examine air traffic flow from a new perspective, enriching the research means. These novel findings will provide theoretical basis for aggregated air traffic flow modeling, decision support system design and tactical flow management. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

In this paper, the authors established a stable and pulsed flow fluidized bed experiment platform. They also collected pressure signals with different times, different frequencies and different gas flow rates in the drying process. The pressure signals were analyzed by two approaches. One is based on the use of the multi-scale complexity entropy causality plane, and the other relies on a recurrence plot. With the drying characteristics of wet particles in the bed and flow pattern, the focus was on influence factors such as time lapse, air intake ratio and pulse frequency on both drying efficiency and the characteristics of complex nonlinear dynamics were analyzed. A study of the micro and macro mechanism of flow characteristics is also presented. The results show that the two approaches (i.e., methods) have a higher accuracy in judging the change of the interaction force between moist particles and the change of flow characteristics. The drying efficiency can be deduced by analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the fluidized bed; thus, the multi-scale complexity entropy causality plane and the structure of the recurrence plot corresponding to the best drying efficiency are obtained. A recommended reference range of the three parameters of a recurrence plot that are good for drying will be presented, which corresponds to the ratio of the stable flow and the pulsed flow.},

The cardiovascular system in sudden cardiac death (SCD) patients appeared to be such dynamical system as the patient meets sudden death within few minutes or an hour after onset of the symptoms. Therefore, the present study was designed to explore an algorithm to predict the SCD 1 hour before the ‘SCD Onset' using recurrence plots of the RR-intervals. The MIT-BIH database was used for designing the samples of the study. The 5 minutes ECG signals of the SCD patients which were 1 hour before the SCD onset and just 5 min before the SCD onset were pre-processed for noise removal and RR-interval extraction. The RR-intervals were then processed to obtain a set of non- linear features using recurrence plots. These fea-tures were checked for correlation among the SCD patients using Spearman's function of correlation. The classification of the optimal features into normal control subjects and SCD was implemented us-ing classifier k-Nearest Neighbor or k-NN classifier. A maximum accuracy of 98.44{\%} was obtained using k-NN. The results indicate that, the proposed algorithm can efficiently identify the person at risk of progressive SCD 1 hour before, which would be helpful in supporting sufficient time for the medical staff attending the patient to respond with preventive treatment.},

The wind speed data used in this study were collected over a period of two years by National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA) from five different stations in the tropics namely; Abuja (7050'02.09»N and 6004'29.97»E), Akungba (6059'05.40»N and 5035'52.23»E), Nsukka (6051'28.14»N and 7024'28.15»E), Port Harcourt (4047'05.41»N and 6059'30.62»E), and Yola (9017'33.58»N and 12023'26.69»E). In this paper, recurrence plot (RP) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) are applied to investigate a non-linear deterministic dynamical process and non-stationarity in hourly wind speed data from the study areas. Using RQA for each month of the two years, it is observed that wind speed data for the wet months exhibit higher chaoticity than that of the dry months for all the stations, due to strong and weak monsoonal effect during the wet and dry seasons respectively. The results show that recurrence techniques are able to identify areas and periods for which the harvest of wind energy for power generation is good (high predictability) and poor (low predictability) in the study areas. This work also validates the RQA measures (Lmax, DET and ENT) used and establishes that they are similar/related as they give similar results for the dynamical characterization of the wind speed data. {\textcopyright} 2018 Author(s).},

abstract = {Fluidization quality of beds containing alumina and iron oxide nanoparticles in the Agglomerate Bubbling Fluidization (ABF) was improved by applying a combination of vibration and magnetic field. Pressure fluctuations were measured and analyzed by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Recurrence Plot (RP) and Recurrence Quantitative Analysis (RQA). Results of FFT showed that the wall vibration creates a periodic signal at 100 Hz which is not originated from the bed hydrodynamics. RP of pressure fluctuations before and after applying the assisting forces showed that the white areas in the plot decrease in size, which indicates an increase in the contribution of meso-structures such as agglomerates and small bubbles. The transition in the equilibrium bed hydrodynamics, between the condition in which assisting forces are not applied and condition in which they are applied, was tracked. It was shown by the determinism of pressure fluctuations that when the iron oxide nanoparticles exist alongside with alumina nanoparticles, this transition to the new equilibrium condition was reached in a shorter time. Determinism of pressure fluctuation of beds containing iron oxide decreased after applying the assisting forces. This trend confirms that large bubbles start to disappear and become substituted by smaller structures when magnetic field is applied to the bed. Under this condition, the interphase contact efficiency increases and the bed becomes closer to the Agglomerate Particle Fluidization (APF) regime.},

abstract = {The electricity supply industry in the United Kingdom underwent a number of regulatory reforms since late 80's that have transformed the trading and pricing of the energy market. Herein we provide empirical evidence that the Modification Proposal P12 (Mod P12) - that took place in 7/2/2002 - moving the Gate Closure (GC) interval from 3.5 h to 1 h before real time has caused a permanent alteration in the UK spot price volatility. Using a combination of Recurrence Plot (RP) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) we find that, after the the change in the GC time, short term price volatility significantly decreased between 2001 and 2008 while long term price volatility is not affected by CG change. Similar results are obtained by means of spectral analysis on the price series, showing a significant reduction in its variability. The results of our analysis suggest that a dynamical regime shift of the price occurred, and such shift is linked to the GC change whereby shorter GC intervals facilitate short-term forecasting on electricity demand and better reliability on the supply side. Therefore, GC closer to real time is associated to reduced price fluctuations in the wholesale market.},

abstract = {Discord search is an important technique for time series analysis, especially for anomaly detection. In recent years, many computational approaches of discord search were studied; however, limitation exists while only the problems with univariate time series data can be well addressed. In this study, we proposed a novel computational framework to identify discords from multivariate time series (MTS) data, namely, LRRDS (Local Recurrence Rate based Discord Search). LRRDS accurately identifies the discords by analyzing a recurrence plot, which is transformed from the original time series data. An innovative strategy was employed to improve the efficiency for pair-wise distance comparison of two subsequences. In the experimental simulations, LRRDS was applied to an extensive number of MTS datasets. Results show that the proposed approach is more efficient than existing methods, such as GDS. In conclusion, the LRRDS approach solves the adaptability problem of discord sequences in multi-dimensional space and guarantees the computational effectiveness and efficiency.},
