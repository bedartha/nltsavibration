abstract = {This thesis introduces Gaussian process dynamical models (GPDMs) for nonlinear time series analysis. A GPDM comprises a low-dimensional latent space with associated dy- namics, and a map from the latent space to an observation space. We marginalize out the model parameters in closed-form, which leads to modeling both dynamics and ob- servation mappings as Gaussian processes. This results in a nonparametric model for dynamical systems that accounts for uncertainty in the model. We train the model on human motion capture data in which each pose is 62-dimensional, and synthesize new motions by sampling from the posterior distribution. A comparison of forecasting results between different covariance functions and sampling methods is provided, and we demon- strate a simple application of GPDM on filling in missing data. Finally, to account for latent space uncertainty, we explore different priors settings on hyperparameters and show some preliminary GPDM learning results using a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm. ii},

abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis is becoming a more and more reliable tool for the study of complicated dynamics from measurements. The concept of low-dimensional chaos has proven to be fruitful in the understanding of many complex phenomena despite the fact that very few natural systems have actually been found to be low dimensional deterministic in the sense of the theory. In order to evaluate the long term usefulness of the nonlinear time series approach as inspired by chaos theory, it will be important that the corresponding methods become more widely accessible. This paper, while not a proper review on nonlinear time series analysis, tries to make a contribution to this process by describing the actual implementation of the algorithms, and their proper usage. Most of the methods require the choice of certain parameters for each specific time series application. We will try to give guidance in this respect. The scope and selection of topics in this article, as well as the implementational choices that have been made, correspond to the contents of the software package TISEAN which is publicly available from http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/{\~{}}tisean . In fact, this paper can be seen as an extended manual for the TISEAN programs. It fills the gap between the technical documentation and the existing literature, providing the necessary entry points for a more thorough study of the theoretical background.},

abstract = {We recorded time series data of calls of Japanese tree frogs (Hyla japonica; Nihon-Ama-Gaeru) and examined the dynamics of the experimentally observed data not only through linear time series analysis such as power spectra but also through nonlinear time series analysis such as reconstruction of orbits with delay coordinates and different kinds of recurrence plots, namely the conventional recurrence plot (RP), the isodirectional recurrence plot (IDRP), and the iso-directional neighbors plot (IDNP). The results show that a single frog called nearly periodically, and a pair of frogs called nearly periodically but alternately in almost anti-phase synchronization with little overlap through mutual interaction. The fundamental frequency of the calls of a single frog during the interactive calling between two frogs was smaller than when the same frog first called alone. We also used the recurrence plots to study nonlinear and nonstationary determinism in the transition of the calling behavior. Moreover, we quantified the determinism of the nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics with indices of the ratio R of the number of points in IDNP to that in RP and the percentage P D  of contiguous points forming diagonal lines in RP by the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Finally, we discuss a possibility of mathematical modeling of the calling behavior and a possible biological meaning of the call alternation.

abstract = {The aim of this research is to study further some latest progress of nonlinear time series analysis, particularly about Wavelet Neural Networks (WNN). There are three main issues that are considered further in this research. The first is some properties of scale and wavelet coefficients from Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) decomposition, particularly at non-stationary time series. The second is about development of model building procedures of WNN based on the properties of scale and wavelet coefficients. Then, the third is empirical study about the implementation of procedures that have been developed and comparison study about the forecast accuracy of WNN to other models. The results show that scale coefficients of MODWT at non-stationary has trend pattern and wavelet coefficients are stationary. The results of model building procedure development yield four procedures for non-stationary time series. In general, these procedures accommodate input lags of scale and wavelet coefficients introduced by Renaud et al. (2003) and other additional lags. The result of empirical study shows that these procedures work well for finding the best WNN model for time series forecasting. The comparison study of forecast accuracy show that the first procedure (with stepwise) of non-stationary time series yields the best forecast compared to ARIMA, MAR and WNN models by using other procedures. It's showed by the smallest RMSE at testing data. {\textcopyright} EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.},

We then explore the use of threshold autoregressive (TAR) models in describing monthly volatility series. The models built suggest that the volatility series exhibit significant lower-order serial correlations when the volatility is large, indicating certain volatility clustering in stock returns. Out-of-sample forecasts are used to compare the TAR models with linear ARMA models and nonlinear GARCH and EGARCH models. Based on mean squared error and average absolute deviation, the comparisons show that (a) the TAR models consistently outperform the linear ARMA models in multi-step ahead forecasts for large stocks, (b) the TAR models provide better forecasts than the GARCH and EGARCH models also for the volatilities of large stock returns, and (c) the EGARCH model gives the best long-horizon volatility forecasts for small stock returns.},

A lower and a higher group of harmonics is influenced by two independent but weakly coupled oscillators. Sometimes the harmonics are well synchronized forming a uniform harmonic pattern with a high harmonic to noise ratio and the noise background is considerably reduced.

abstract = {The classical approach towards time series analysis of fluctuating phenomena is based on linear stochastic processes in the basin of attraction of globally stable equilibria (ARMA models). However, there are deductive reasons derived from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics that many self-generated population fluctuations should be interpreted as stochastic processes influenced by nonequilibrium attractors of nonlinear dynamical systems. The incidence pattern of measles epidemics in New York City is used to demonstrate that highly nonlinear autoregressive models can serve as a new semi-phenomenological level of description for complex self-generated fluctuations in biological or ecological systems. The nature of the unpredictability of the incidence pattern of measles is characterized by a subtle interaction between a chaotic nonlinear determinism and stochastic fluctuations. The sensitive dependence on initial conditions, characteristic for chaos, is not limited to chaotic attractors but can also occur on so-called chaotic transients. The dynamics of recurrent outbreaks of measles in New York City turns out to be close to a so-called boundary crisis which converts a stable chaotic attractor to metastable chaotic transients leading finally to a period-3 attractor. However, the demographic noise destabilizes the periodic orbit as well, and creates a situation of intermittent jumps between episodic periodicities and longer chaotic transients. A simple autoregressive model is used to achieve a plausible geometric understanding of the noise-induced intermittency switching between episodic periodicity and transient chaos. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Most of these studies are based primarily on correlation dimension estimates, and conclude that the dynamics of the ECG signal is deterministic and occurs on a chaotic attractor, whose dimension can distinguish between healthy and severely malfunctioning cases. In this paper, we first demonstrate that correlation dimension calculations must be used with care, as they do not always yield reliable estimates of the attractor's "dimension." We then carry out a number of additional tests (time differencing, smoothing, principal component analysis, surrogate data analysis, etc.) on the ECGs of three "normal" subjects and three "heavy smokers" at rest and after mild exercising, whose cardiac rhythms look very similar. Our main conclusion is that no major dynamical differences are evident in these signals. A preliminary estimate of three to four basic variables governing the dynamics (based on correlation dimension calculations) is updated to five to six, when temporal correlations between points are removed. Finally, in almost all cases, the transition between resting and mild exercising seems to imply a small increase in the complexity of cardiac dynamics. (c) 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We report on the analysis of experiments on a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser with an intracavity frequency-doubling crystal. Three modes of the laser were excited in differing polarization configurations. The total intensity of infrared light was observed and then analyzed using methods of nonlinear-time-series analysis. We present clear evidence using global false nearest neighbors that when all polarizations are parallel, the intensity is chaotic with two positive Lyapunov exponents and the system can be embedded in dimension 7. The noise level in this operating condition, which we call type I chaos, is small. When one of the polarizations is perpendicular to the others, the intensity is again chaotic with positive Lyapunov exponents, but there is substantial noise in the signal of high dimensional origin, and no finite embedding dimension appears possible. We call this type II chaos. We suggest that the origin of this phenomenon is the intrinsic quantum noise associated with the generation of green light, which is 25 times more intense in the type II operating configuration than in the first. In past experiments with this system we have found that the type I chaos can be controlled to unstable periodic orbits while type II cannot. In each type of chaotic laser operation we use local false nearest neighbors to demonstrate that the local dimension of the dynamics is 7. This means seven differential equations can capture the full dynamics of these regimes of the laser. We evaluate local and global false nearest neighbors to support our conclusions and determine the Lyapunov spectrum of each type of chaotic behavior. The predictability of type II chaos is shown to be much less than that of type I, and we make local polynomial models in reconstructed-state space to demonstrate that we can predict rather well for type I chaos. Finally we suggest a fairly standard model for the interaction of the infrared light with the nonlinear frequency doubling medium and with a two-level of the active medium. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {This paper presents a neural network approach to time-series analysis of a univariate nonlinear system. Feedforward networks are studied, and an appropriate network size is determined by different criteria computed on the basis of the performance of the models on the training and test sets. The analysis and conclusions drawn are supported by studies of the phase portraits of the models. By a proper choice of network size, the problems of over-parameterization are demonstrated to be avoided. The overfitting observed for larger networks is analyzed and the underlying reasons for their worse generalization capabilities are explained. Finally, some observations are made on the approximation provided by an oversized network with weights determined by an incomplete (interrupted) training and that of the optimal-sized network.},

abstract = {Are traditional social science methods incapable of dealing with the complex and indeterminant problems facing public management today? It is not so much the wedding of scientific logic and method to management theory and practice that is problematic as it is the outdated models of scientific inquiry that slow our progress. The new sciences of chaos and quantum theory offer valuable metaphors and methods that can challenge the public management research agenda into the next century. Chaos administration evokes the image of self-organization, dissipative structures, and dynamic complexity. The methods of chaos presented here are nonlinear differential equations and nonlinear time-series analysis with phase diagrams. Quantum administration provides a new logic of complementarity, constructivism, and participatory collusion in organizations and management. The quantum methods outlined and applied are Heisenberg's principle of indeterminism and Born's rules of probabilistic interpretation. The metaphors and methods of chaos and quantum theory are applied to familiar management issues such as performance appraisal and budgeting.},

The 1848–1992 biweekly time series of the Great Salt Lake (GSL) volume is analyzed for evidence of low dimensional dynamics and predictability. The spectrum of Lyapunov exponents indicates that the average predictability of the GSL is a few hundred days. Use of the false nearest neighbor statistic shows that the dynamics of the GSL can be described in time delay coordinates by four dimensional vectors with components lagged by about half a year. Local linear maps are used in this embedding of the data and their skill in forecasting is tested in split sample mode for a variety of GSL conditions: lake average volume, near the beginning of a drought, near the end of a drought, prior to a period of rapid lake rise. Implications for modeling low frequency components of the hydro-climate system are discussed.},

Time series of fluctuating floating potential $\phi$ f and ion saturation current I sat from the reciprocating probe array have been analysed for skewness and kurtosis as indications of intermittency in the turbulence. Provided the time series are carefully selected for stationarity, the skewness S and kurtosis K are consistent with Gaussian probability distributions in both L-and H-modes. Wavelet bicoherence analysis reveals the presence of intermittency in the coupling due to sum frequencies above 400 kHz in both the L-and H-modes. The intermittency is most pronounced in the H-mode, with the intervals of strong coupling correlated with changes in local edge plasma conditions. These results appear consistent with predictions from self-organized criticality models.},

abstract = {The relative importance of chaotic dynamics versus stochastic processes in the evolution of El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is examined in three different types of coupled models - an intermediate coupled model (ICM), a hybrid general circulation model (HGCM) and a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (CGCM). It is shown that in both the ICM and HGCM whose atmospheric components contain no internal high-frequency variability, irregularity of ENSO can be described by a low-order chaotic process generated by nonlinear interaction between the seasonal cycle and interannual oscillation. Numerical experiments reveal that the behavior of the ENSO cycle in this class of coupled models is sensitive to changes in coupling strength. By increasing the coupling strength, the model ENSO cycles evolve from nonoscillatory (stable) to time-periodic (unstable) and eventually to chaotic regimes. Although these models give reasonable ENSO frequency and spatial structure compared with observations, the phase-locking with the annual cycle is apparently too strong. Inclusion of stochastic forcing in these models can have two effects on the ENSO cycles. It can break up strong annual phase-locking in the unstable regime and it can also excite ENSO-like variability in the stable regime, where the coupling strength is so weak that no self-sustaining oscillations can exist in the coupled models. In contrast, the ENSO cycle in the CGCM, where internal high-frequency fluctuations are included, does not appear to be driven by a low-order chaos. By comparing the invariant properties of the dynamics derived from long-term sea surface temperature time series obtained from the different coupled models, it was found that the dynamical characteristics of the CGCM response were similar to those of the ICM forced with stochastic forcing in the stable regime, suggesting that the ENSO cycles in the CGCM may be dominated by stable dynamics driven by stochastic processes. Testing for nonlinearity gives further support to this result. The nonlinear time series analysis also implies that stochastic processes rather than chaotic dynamics are likely to be a major source of ENSO irregularity in reality.

It has been proposed that oscillations in northern vole populations are driven by their interaction with specialist predators (weasels), while the more southern rodent populations are relatively stable because of regulation by generalist predators. We tested this generalist/specialist predation hypothesis by constructing an empirically based model for vole population dynamics, estimating its parameters, and making predictions about the quantitative pattern of the latitudinal shift in vole dynamics. Our results indicated that the model accurately predicted the latitudinal shift in the amplitude and periodicity of population fluctuations. Moreover, the model predicted that vole dynamics should shift from stable to chaotic as latitude is increased, a result in agreement with nonlinear time-series analysis of the data. The striking success of the model at predicting the shifts in amplitude and stability along the geographical gradient in northern Europe provides strong support for the key role of specialist and generalist predators in vole population dynamics.},

abstract = {Recent theories of the effects of ethanol on the brain have focused on its direct actions on neuronal membrane proteins. However, neuromolecular mechanisms whereby ethanol produces its CNS effects in low doses typically used by social drinkers (e.g., 2-3 drinks, 10-25 mM, 0.05-0.125 gm/dl) remain less well understood. We propose the hypothesis that ethanol may act by introducing a level of randomness or "noise" in brain electrical activity. We investigated the hypothesis by applying a battery of tests originally developed for nonlinear time series analysis and chaos theory to EEG data collected from 32 men who had participated in an ethanol/placebo challenge protocol. Because nonlinearity is a prerequisite for chaos and because we can detect nonlinearity more reliably than chaos, we concentrated on a series of measures that quantitated different aspects of nonlinearity. For each of these measures the method of surrogate data was used to assess the significance of evidence for nonlinear structure. Significant nonlinear structure was found in the EEG as evidenced by the measures of time asymmetry, determinism, and redundancy. In addition, the evidence for nonlinear structure in the placebo condition was found to be significantly greater than that for ethanol. Nonlinear measures, but not spectral measures, were found to correlate with a subject's overall feeling of intoxication. These findings are consistent with the notion that ethanol may act by introducing a level of randomness in neuronal processing as assessed by EEG nonlinear structure.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate whether a correct lateralization of the primary epileptogenic area by means of neuronal complexity loss analysis can be obtained from interictal EEG recordings using semi-invasive foramen ovale electrodes. In a previous study with recordings from intrahippocampal depth and subdural strip electrodes it was shown that the dynamics of the primary epileptogenic area can be characterized by an increased loss of neuronal complexity in patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). METHODS: Neuronal complexity loss analysis was applied. This analysis method is derived from the theory of nonlinear dynamics and provides a topological diagnosis even in cases where no actual seizure activity can be recorded. We examined interictal EEG recorded intracranially from multipolar foramen ovale electrodes in 19 patients with unilateral TLE undergoing presurgical evaluation. RESULTS: The primary epileptogenic area was correctly lateralized in 16 of the 19 investigated patients. The misclassification of the side of seizure onset in three patients might be attributed to the larger distance between the foramen ovale electrodes and the mesial temporal structures as compared to intrahippocampal depth electrodes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the previous findings and provide further evidence for the usefulness of nonlinear time-series analysis for the characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the primary epileptogenic area in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.},

The aim of the present work is to check whether low-dimensional deterministic chaos can be an explanation for the irregular, random-like oscillations of the surface plasma induced during laser welding. The standard procedures of nonlinear time series analysis like the embedding technique, noise reduction by projection on the local manifold, calculations of the correlation dimension using the G–P algorithm, and looking for the largest Lyapunov exponent are applied. After cleaning original time series from the noise, 3D phase portraits displaying more or less regular structures of attractors were reconstructed. The values of the estimated fractal dimensions of these attractors lay in the range ]2; 3[, for various cleaning conditions. The plots of the average orbits' ‘divergence' calculated for the estimation of the largest Lyapunov exponent display behaviour which is typically observed in chaotic systems. The value of the largest Lyapunov exponent obtained from the slope of the orbits' divergence curves is for our welding conditions, about 5 10−3 s−1 and the average ‘period' of the plasma oscillation is estimated to be 10−3 s. This means that the system is highly unpredictable. These results indicate that fluctuations of laser induced plasmas represent deterministic chaos and a nonlinear dynamical system consisting of several ordinary differential equations can be used for modelling laser welding.},

abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis is becoming a more and more reliable tool for the study of complicated dynamics from measurements. The concept of low-dimensional chaos has proven to be fruitful in the understanding of many complex phenomena despite the fact that very few natural systems have actually been found to be low dimensional deterministic in the sense of the theory. In order to evaluate the long term usefulness of the nonlinear time series approach as inspired by chaos theory, it will be important that the corresponding methods become more widely accessible. This paper, while not a proper review on nonlinear time series analysis, tries to make a contribution to this process by describing the actual implementation of the algorithms, and their proper usage. Most of the methods require the choice of certain parameters for each specific time series application. We will try to give guidance in this respect. The scope and selection of topics in this article, as well as the implementational choices that have been made, correspond to the contents of the software package TISEAN which is publicly available from http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/{\~{}}tisean .

abstract = {The well-known neural mass model described by Lopes da Silva et al. (1976) and Zetterberg et al. (1978) is fitted to actual EEG data. This is achieved by reformulating the original set of integral equations as a continuous-discrete state space model. The local linearization approach is then used to discretize the state equation and to construct a nonlinear Kalman filter. On this basis, a maximum likelihood procedure is used for estimating the model parameters for several EEG recordings. The analysis of the noise-free differential equations of the estimated models suggests that there are two different types of alpha rhythms: those with a point attractor and others with a limit cycle attractor. These attractors are also found by means of a nonlinear time series analysis of the EEG recordings. We conclude that the Hopf bifurcation described by Zetterberg et al. (1978) is present in actual brain dynamics.},

abstract = {Enzymatic liquefaction conditions were evaluated to obtain fructan from wild sotol plant (Dasylirion wheeleri) using the commercial preparation Pectinex Ultra SP-L. Ground sotol head was subjected to enzymatic extraction at various enzyme activities (0.0–175.73 U/mL) and fresh sotol concentrations (4.47–28.52 g/100 mL) at 30 °C for 8 h, using the response surface methodology to optimize the fructan extraction. Reducing sugars (RS), total carbohydrates (TC), fructan content (FRU), fructan profile, and the average degree of polymerization (DPn) were evaluated. Additionally, RS release kinetics and the enzyme rate constant (V0) were calculated. Enzyme concentration and substrate significantly affected (P {\textless} 0.05) the RS extraction, FRU, and V0, while DPn was only affected (P {\textless} 0.05) by the substrate concentration. Higher RS contents were obtained at lower substrate concentrations for {\textgreater} 87.87 U/mL enzyme, and fructan extraction was maximal (39.08 g/100 g d.m.) at 83.04 U/mL enzyme and 6.70 g/100 mL substrate. V0 and RS content exhibited similar trends. DPn increased as substrate concentration decreased. Optimal enzymatic liquefaction conditions were 11.6–45.6 U/mL enzyme and 9.15–12.6 g/100 mL sotol, yielding elevated fructan (38.58 g/100 g d.m.), DPn of 8–10, and low fructose (1.8 g/100 g d.m.) and glucose (2.2 g/100 g d.m.) contents. These results demonstrate the feasibility of enzymatic liquefaction for extracting fructans from sotol heads without modifying the molecular structure.},

Using nonlinear AR to quantify interactions between the mean and autocovariance of a signal, analysts can discriminate asymmetric frequency components, estimate the relative contribution of system nonlinearities toward mean output, evaluate relative structural stability of a system, and predict critical regions where bifurcations in its dynamics might occur. Quadratic analyses are performed on simulated outputs from a nonlinear model and various experimental time series (Canadian lynx population, respiratory volume dynamics in rat, Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with congestive heart failure, intracranial pressures in patient with cerebral hematoma).

We found that what we call KL-complexity of the signal differs profoundly for the signals registered in different EEG channels, from about 5-8 for signals in frontal channels up to 40 and more in occipital ones. But no consistency in the influence of Diazepam administration on KL-complexity is observed. We also estimated the embedding dimension of the EEG signals of the same subjects, which turned to be between 7 and 11, so endorsing the presumption about existence of low-dimensional chaotic attractor.

Highly dissimilar growth patterns and copper removal efficiency were observed for the selected Streptomyces strains grown on minimal medium (MM) added with 0.5 mM of copper sulfate (MM(Cu)).

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. Self-sustained oscillatory dynamics is a motion along a stable limit cycle in the phase space, and it arises in a wide variety of mechanical, electrical, and biological systems. Typically, oscillations are due to a balance between energy dissipation and generation. Their stability depends on the properties of the attractor, in particular, its dissipative characteristics, which in turn determine the flexibility of a given dynamical system. In a network of oscillators, the coupling additionally contributes to the dissipation, and hence affects the robustness of the oscillatory solution. Here, we therefore investigate how a heterogeneous network structure affects the dissipation rate of individual oscillators. First, we show that in a network of diffusively coupled oscillators, the dissipation is a linearly decreasing function of the node degree, and we demonstrate this numerically by calculating the average divergence of coupled Hopf oscillators. Subsequently, we use recordings of intracellular calcium dynamics in pancreatic beta cells in mouse acute tissue slices and the corresponding functional connectivity networks for an experimental verification of the presented theory. We use methods of nonlinear time series analysis to reconstruct the phase space and calculate the sum of Lyapunov exponents. Our analysis reveals a clear tendency of cells with a higher degree, that is, more interconnected cells, having more negative values of divergence, thus confirming our theoretical predictions. We discuss these findings in the context of energetic aspects of signaling in beta cells and potential risks for pathological changes in the tissue.},

A common finding is that there is substantial evidence in favor of some nonlinear structure (see, for example, Scheinkman and LeBaron (1989), Hsieh (1991), or Hsieh (1989) for applications to stock returns), although there still exists a lively debate as to whether members of the GARCH family of models (Bollerslev et al. (1992) provide a broad survey of these) are able to capture all of the important nonlinear features of the data (see Brooks (1996)). The motivations for this line of inquiry are at least twofold. First, a finding of nonlinear dependence implies that expenditure of research effort to include nonlinear models as plausible functional forms is probably a worthwhile exercise. Second, nonlinear dependence may also imply hitherto unrevealed forecastability in the series, although the evidence to date on the relative forecasting performance of nonlinear time series models is largely negative (see Ramsey (1996) for a discussion of and suggested explanations for this phenomenon).},

abstract = {Characterizing locomotor dynamics is essential for understanding the neuromuscular control of locomotion. In particular, quantifying dynamic stability during walking is important for assessing people who have a greater risk of falling. However, traditional biomechanical methods of defining stability have not quantified the resistance of the neuromuscular system to perturbations, suggesting that more precise definitions are required. For the present study, average maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponents were estimated to quantify the local dynamic stability of human walking kinematics. Local scaling exponents, defined as the local slopes of the correlation sum curves, were also calculated to quantify the local scaling structure of each embedded time series. Comparisons were made between overground and motorized treadmill walking in young healthy subjects and between diabetic neuropathic (NP) patients and healthy controls (CO) during overground walking. A modification of the method of surrogate data was developed to examine the stochastic nature of the fluctuations overlying the nominally periodic patterns in these data sets. Results demonstrated that having subjects walk on a motorized treadmill artificially stabilized their natural locomotor kinematics by small but statistically significant amounts. Furthermore, a paradox previously present in the biomechanical literature that resulted from mistakenly equating variability with dynamic stability was resolved. By slowing their self-selected walking speeds, NP patients adopted more locally stable gait patterns, even though they simultaneously exhibited greater kinematic variability than CO subjects. Additionally, the loss of peripheral sensation in NP patients was associated with statistically significant differences in the local scaling structure of their walking kinematics at those length scales where it was anticipated that sensory feedback would play the greatest role. Lastly, stride-to-stride fluctuations in the walking patterns of all three subject groups were clearly distinguishable from linearly autocorrelated Gaussian noise. As a collateral benefit of the methodological approach taken in this study, some of the first steps at characterizing the underlying structure of human locomotor dynamics have been taken. Implications for understanding the neuromuscular control of locomotion are discussed. (c) 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

In the absence of an independent way to determine anesthesia depth, the standard was derived from measured blood plasma concentrations of the anesthetic via a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for the estimated effective brain concentration of sevoflurane. In most patients, the highest correlation is observed for the nonlinear correlation index D*. In contrast to spectral measures, D* is found to decrease monotonically with increasing (estimated) depth of anesthesia, even when a "burst-suppression" pattern occurs in the EEG.

The R/S analysis provided evidence for fractality due to noisy chaos in only two of the data series, while the BDS test showed that all four systems exhibit nonlinearity. Correlation dimension and related tests, as well as Lyapunov exponents, gave consistent results, which did not rule out the possibility of deterministic chaos for the two possibly fractal series, rejecting though the occurrence of a simple low-dimensional attractor, while the other two series seemed to have followed a behavior close to that of a random signal. SVD analysis, used to filter away noise, strongly supported the above findings and provided reliable evidence for the existence of an underlying system with a limited number of degrees-of-freedom only for those series found to exhibit fractality, while it revealed a noise domination over the remaining two. These results were further confirmed through a forecasting attempt using artificial neural networks.},

abstract = {Deterministic chaos offers a striking explanation for apparently irregular behavior of the brain that is evidenced in the EEG. Recent developments in the physical-mathematical framework of the theory of nonlinear dynamics (colloquially often termed chaos theory) provide new concepts and powerful algorithms to analyze such time series. Because of its high versatility, nonlinear time series analysis has already gone beyond the physical sciences and, at present, is being successfully applied in a variety of disciplines, including cardiology, neurology, psychiatry, and epileptology. However, it is well known that different influencing factors limit the use of nonlinear measures to characterize EEG dynamics in a strict sense. Nevertheless, when interpreted with care, relative estimates of, e.g., the correlation dimension or the Lyapunov exponents, can reliably characterize different states of normal and pathologic brain function. In epileptology, extraction of nonlinear measures from the intracranially recorded EEG promises to be important for clinical practice. In addition to an immense reduction of information content of long-lasting EEG recordings, previous studies have shown that these measures enable (a) localization of the primary epileptogenic area in different cerebral regions during the interictal state, (b) investigations of antiepileptic drug effects, (c) analyses of spatio-temporal interactions between the epileptogenic zone and other brain areas, and (d) detection of features predictive of imminent seizure activity. Nonlinear time series analysis provides new and supplementary information about the epileptogenic process and thus contributes to an improvement in presurgical evaluation.},

The effects of three main factors - input nodes, hidden nodes and sample size, are examined through a simulated computer experiment. Results show that neural networks are valuable tools for modeling and forecasting nonlinear time series while traditional linear methods are not as competent for this task. The number of input nodes is much more important than the number of hidden nodes in neural network model building for forecasting. Moreover, large sample is helpful to ease the overfitting problem. Scope and purpose Interest in using artificial neural networks for forecasting has led to a tremendous surge in research activities in the past decade. Yet, mixed results are often reported in the literature and the effect of key modeling factors on performance has not been thoroughly examined. The lack of systematic approaches to neural network model building is probably the primary cause of inconsistencies in reported findings.

For signal analysis, methods of spectral analysis and methods of nonlinear time series analysis are used. With the aim of modeling relationships between signal characteristics and the corresponding process state, an adaptive empirical modeler is applied. The application of the system is demonstrated by characterization of different parameters defining the states of a turning machining process, such as: chip form, tool wear, and onset of chatter vibration. The results show that, in spite of the complexity of the turning process, the state of the process can be well characterized by just a few proper characteristics extracted from a representative sensor signal. The process characterization can be further improved by joining characteristics from multiple sensors and by application of chaotic characteristics.},

abstract = {Patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy are significantly more likely to fall while walking than subjects with intact sensation. While it has been suggested that these patients walk slower to improve locomotor stability, slower speeds are also associated with increased locomotor variability, and increased variability has traditionally been equated with loss of stability. If the latter were true, this would suggest that slowing down, as a locomotor control strategy, should be completely antithetical to the goal of maintaining stability. The present study resolves these seemingly paradoxical findings by using methods from nonlinear time series analysis to directly quantify the sensitivity of the locomotor system to local perturbations that are manifested as natural kinematic variability. Fourteen patients with severe peripheral neuropathy and 12 gender-, age-, height-, and weight-matched non-diabetic controls participated. Sagittal plane angles of the right hip, knee, and ankle joints and tri-axial accelerations of the trunk were measured during 10min of continuous overground walking at self-selected speeds. Maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponents were computed for each time series to quantify the local dynamic stability of these movements. Neuropathic patients exhibited slower walking speeds and better local dynamic stability of upper body movements in the horizontal plane than did control subjects. The differences in local dynamic stability were significantly predicted by differences in walking speed, but not by differences in sensory status. These results support the hypothesis that reductions in walking speed are a compensatory strategy used by neuropathic patients to maintain dynamic stability of the upper body during level walking.

abstract = {The paper presents a data-driven approach to the modelling and forecasting of hydrological systems based on nonlinear time-series analysis. Time varying parameters are estimated using a combined Kalman filter and fixed-interval-smoother, and state-dependent parameter relations are identified leading to nonlinear extensions to common time-series models such as the autoregressive exogenous (ARX) and general transfer function (TF). This nonlinear time-series technique is used as part of a data-based mechanistic modelling methodology where models are objectively identified from the data, but are only accepted as a reasonable representation of the system if they have a valid mechanistic interpretation. To this end it is shown that the TF model can represent a general linear storage model that subsumes many common hydrological flow forecasting models, and that the rainfall-runoff process can be represented using a nonlinear input transformation in combination with a TF model. One advantage of the forecasting models produced is that the Kalman filter can be used for real-time state updating leading to improved forecasts and an estimate of associated forecast uncertainty. Rainfall-runoff and flood routing case studies are included to demonstrate the power of the modelling and forecasting methods. One important conclusion is that optimal system identification techniques are required to objectively identify parallel flow pathways.},

abstract = {The present work addresses two central questions in the analysis of time series. The first part deals with methods to test for non- linear structure in measured signals. Only a positive outcome of such a test justifies the application of the advanced techniques of nonlinear time series analysis. We will discuss some limitations and caveats of the popular method of surrogate data for nonlinea- rity tests. Further we present a new way to generate surrogate data that overcomes these caveats and features an extraordinary flexibility. This flexibility for the first time allows e.g. to test for nonlinearity in unevenly sampled time series. Further examples and applications of the new method are studied. The second part of the present work deals with the analysis of de- pendencies between time series. This is motivated by the recently rising interest in synchronisation phenomena of coupled chaotic systems. The central practical question is, whether one can tell the dominant direction of the coupling between two systems. Stan- dard measures of interdependencies are not optimized to answer this question. To address this problem, two new concepts will be developed and discussed. The first measure is motivated by in- formation theory and is called transfer entropy, while the second is oriented closer to synchronisation itself. We shall demonstrate that we are indeed able to tell the direction of coupling by the asymmetry of the measures. Further investigations on unidirec- tionally coupled map lattices reveal further interesting properties. Finally we present some first applications to experimental data.},

In the present study, this analysis framework was extended by introducing a new measure $\xi$, designed to discriminate between nonlinear deterministic and linear stochastic dynamics. For the evaluation of its discriminative power, $\xi$ was extracted from intracranial multi-channel EEGs recorded during the interictal state in 25 patients with unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Strong indications of nonlinear determinism were found in recordings from within the epileptogenic zone, while EEG signals from other sites mainly resembled linear stochastic dynamics.

abstract = {Summary form only given. We start by opposing the two paradigms of stochasticity (most clearly represented by Gaussian autoregressive models) and deterministic chaos. We present several examples (heart, nephrons, epileptic seizures) where evidence for the latter has been found. We then start the more technical part by discussing time delay embeddings and the choices of parameters for them. After that we shall discuss noise reduction algorithms and algorithms for signal separation based on the geometry of embeddings. In particular we shall present the extraction of fetal heart beat from a univariate ECG signal. We then discuss classical invariants (metric entropy, attractor dimension, Lyapunov exponents) and argue why using them as indicators for chaotic determinism is not very useful. The same should be true also for alternatives like false nearest neighbors or forecasting errors. In contrast we shall argue that strict determinism is not needed for the arsenal of nonlinear time series analysis to be useful. We shall argue that the above observables can indeed be very useful in clinical applications. As an illustration we shall discuss evidence that epileptic seizures can be predicted and epileptic foci can be localized by using. dimension-like observables. Typical features of deterministic chaos are the existence of unstable periodic orbits and the possibility to control such systems by arbitrarily small perturbances. We shall comment on claims that such periodic orbits have been found in biomedical systems, and we shall discuss whether chaos control could eventually be used in intelligent heart pacemakers. Finally, we shall discuss various methods to study interdependencies between different time series. These include cross correlation and coherence, mutual information, phase synchronization, and other interdependence measures. We shall discuss their usefulness in EEG analysis, in particular for epilepsy patients. Among these measures, of particular interest are asymmetric measures because they could, independent of time delays, indicate causal connections. Again this is illustrated with epileptic EEGs.},

abstract = {Several recent studies emphasize the high value of nonlinear EEG analysis particularly for improved characterization of epileptic brain states. In this review the authors report their work to increase insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of the epileptogenic process. Specifically, they discuss possibilities for seizure anticipa- tion, which is one of the most challenging aspects of epileptology. Although there are numerous studies exploring basic neuronal mechanisms that are likely to be associated with seizures, to date no definite information is available regarding how, when, or why a seizure occurs. Nonlinear EEG analysis now provides strong evidence that the interictal–ictal state transition is not an abrupt phenomenon. Rather, findings indicate that it is indeed possible to detect a preseizure phase. The unequivocal definition of such a state with a sufficient length would enable investigations of basic mechanisms leading to seizure initiation in humans, and development of adequate seizure preven- tion strategies. Key Words: Epilepsy—Interictal state—Preictal state—Seizure antic- ipation—Seizure prevention—Focus localization—Nonlinear time series analysis— EEG.},

abstract = {Much of nonlinear time series analysis is concerned with inferring unmeasured quantities - e.g., system parameters, the shape of attractors in state space - from a noisy measured time series. From a Bayesian perspective, the time series is a vector sample picked at random from a probability density. The density reflects the system dynamics and our subjective uncertainty about system parameters, the measurement function, dynamical noise and measurement noise. The conditional probability density of the system parameters given the measured data is the basis of a Bayesian estimate of the system parameters. Using illustrative chaotic systems with large-amplitude dynamical and measurement noise, we show here that it is feasible to use the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to generate the Bayesian conditional probabilities. The resulting parameter estimates are markedly superior to those based on conventional least-squares methods: the MCMC-based estimates are unbiased and allow estimates of dynamical parameters on unmeasured components of the state vector. In addition, the MCMC method enables de-noised attractors to be reconstructed, not just in an embedding based on lags of measured variables but in the state space that includes unmeasured components of the dynamics' state vector. The general purpose MCMC technique effectively combines techniques of nonlinear noise reduction and nonlinear parameter estimation. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Based on a probabilistic interpretation of FLL, this paper proposes a hybrid learning scheme for FLL modeling, which uses a modified adaptive spline modeling (MASMOD) algorithm to construct the antecedent parts (membership functions) in the FLL model, and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to parameterize the consequent parts (local linear models). The hybrid method not only has an approximation ability as good as most neuro-fuzzy network models, but also produces a parsimonious network structure (gain from MASMOD) and provides covariance information about the model error (gain from EM) which is valuable in applications such as state estimation and control. Numerical examples on nonlinear time-series analysis and nonlinear trajectory estimation using FLL models are presented to validate the derived algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2001 IEEE.},

Time series analysis methodology has been widely accepted as a powerful tool for this subject. BWR stability has been so far evaluated by decaying ratio (DR) calculated from the impulse response function of autoregressive (AR) model. To explore much more reliable method for detecting BWR instability, this paper introduces a nonlinear time series analysis approach namely exponential autoregressive (ExpAR) modeling. The ExpAR model is available for revealing types of nonlinear dynamics such as fixed point, limit cycle, and even chaos. Furthermore, the model is real-time estimated so that it is suitable for the purpose of on-line BWR instability detection. Empirical analysis of typical benchmark neutronic signal shows the effectiveness of this proposal. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The PPG signal could be separated into the following 3 components: 1) A baseline, nonlinear-time-dependent nonstationary nonstationarity of the PPG signal. 2) A nonlinear, time invariant deterministic limit-cycle component, which corresponds to the generation of pulsatile waves, the most relevant point of the PPG signal in clinical studies. 3) A stochastic component, which is at least partially fractal. This component bears less than 5{\%} of the variance of the baseline-corrected signal. The sum of the baseline (1) plus the stochastic (3) components accounts for the fractal-like properties of the original PPG signal.

The recurrence plots, spatiotemporal entropy and the result of the surrogate data test show the deterministic nature of the fluctuations, rejecting the hypothesis that H belong to the family of linear stochastic signals. The low dimensional character of the dynamics is evident from the estimated value of the correlation dimension and the fraction of false neighbours calculated for various embedding dimensions. The exponential decay of the power spectrum and the positive Lyapunov exponent indicate chaotic behaviour of the underlying dynamics of H. This is also supported by the results of the comparison of the chaotic characteristics of the time series of H with the pseudo-chaotic characteristics of coloured noise time series. We have also shown that the error involved in the short-term prediction of successive values of H, using a simple but robust, zero-order nonlinear prediction method, increases exponentially. It has also been suggested that there exists the possibility of characterizing the geomagnetic fluctuations in terms of the invariants in chaos theory, such as Lyapunov exponents and correlation dimension. The results of the analysis could also have implications in the development of a suitable model for the daily fluctuations of geomagnetic horizontal intensity.},

We investigated the role of predation in population cycles in an undisturbed large-mammal system using long-term data on the sustained density fluctuations of wolves and moose on Isle Royale (Michigan, USA). Nonlinear time-series analysis revealed that wolves display phase-dependent dynamics with stronger density dependence during the decline phase than during the increase phase. This phase dependence was also reflected in predation rates: the number of moose killed daily by wolves was greater during the wolf increase phase than during the wolf decline phase. Accordingly, moose displayed multi-annual cycles generated by an interaction between weak self-regulation and strong delayed density dependence during periods of wolf increase, and strong self-regulation with negligible delayed density dependence during periods of wolf decline. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first formal documentation of population cycles in large mammals. By making use of long-term data at both trophic levels, as well as data on predator behavior, this analysis may, shed light on the mechanisms through which predators contribute to population cycles of prey in other taxa.},

The dynamical characteristics of seismicity before and after four recent large earthquakes in the Caucasian region have been investigated. Nonlinear time-series analysis techniques, such as calculation of the correlation dimension for sliding windows and surrogate data analysis tests have been used; inter-event time-interval sequences have been considered as a time series. It was determined that the dynamics of lithospheric processes, generating the temporal distributions of earthquakes, do not change qualitatively before and after the largest Caucasian earthquakes. Inter-event time-interval sequences reveal low-dimensional nonlinear structure in both situations.

Concepts such as a random set mapping and its coverage function are introduced in a comprehensive way, avoiding too much detail. We adapt this theory to system identification and forecasting of time series. This is achieved by using the one-point coverage function of a random set as a possibility measure of the process which generates such a time series. The coverage function of a random set defines a fuzzy set, and we thereby establish the relationship between statistical objects and fuzzy systems. The possibility measure obtained in this way can be used for either prediction or to evaluate the quality of a model with respect to the training data. The technique is adapted to nonlinear time series analysis. A practical application of a nonlinear dynamic plant is presented},

abstract = {Higher variability in rainfall and river discharge could be of major importance in landslide generation in the north-western Argentine Andes. Annual layered (varved) deposits of a landslide dammed lake in the Santa Maria Basin (26 deg S, 66 deg W) with an age of 30,000 14C years provide an archive of precipitation variability during this time. The comparison of these data with present-day rainfall observations tests the hypothesis that increased rainfall variability played a major role in landslide generation. A potential cause of such variability is the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The causal link between ENSO and local rainfall is quantified by using a new method of nonlinear data analysis, the quantitative analysis of cross recurrence plots (CRP). This method seeks similarities in the dynamics of two different processes, such as an ocean-atmosphere oscillation and local rainfall. Our analysis reveals significant similarities in the statistics of both modern and palaeo-precipitation data. The similarities in the data suggest that an ENSO-like influence on local rainfall was present at around 30,000 14C years ago. Increased rainfall, which was inferred from a lake balance modeling in a previous study, together with ENSO-like cyclicities could help to explain the clustering of landslides at around 30,000 14C years ago.},

We re- examined data on budmoth density, plant quality, and parasitism rates. Our results suggest that the effect of plant quality on budmoth density is weak. By contrast, a simple model of budmoth–parasitoid interaction accounts for 90{\%} of the variance in budmoth population growth rates. Thus, contrary to previous studies, we find that parasitoid–budmoth interaction appears to be the dominant factor driving the budmoth cycle.},

The open- and closed-loop model developed by Collins and De Luca is a direct consequence of those statistical problems. Applying more classical methods, such as rescaled range analysis or detrended fluctuation analysis, the authors show that center-of-pressure trajectories can be modeled as continuous, antipersistent fractional Brownian motion. More specifically, those trajectories behave like 1/f noise, a ubiquitous feature in adaptive biological systems.},

In symbolic nonlinear time series analysis a time series for a fixed delay is partitioned into a small number (called the alphabet size) of cells labeled by symbols, creating a symbolic time series. Symbolic methods involve computing the statistics of words made from the symbolic time series. Specifically, the Shannon entropy of the distribution of possible words for a range of word lengths is computed. The rate of increase of the entropy with word length is the metric (Kolmogorov-Sinai) entropy. Methods of computing the metric entropy for flows as well as for maps are shown. A method of computing the information dimension appropriate to symbolic analysis is proposed. In terms of this formulation, the information dimension is determined by the scaling of entropy as alphabet size is modestly increased, using the information obtained from large word length. We discuss the role of sampling time and the issue of using these methods when there may be no generating partition.},

Quasicycles produced in this way display a regular period but varied amplitude. They were proposed by Nisbet and Gurney (Nature 263 (1976) 319) as one possible explanation for population fluctuations in nature. Here, we revisit quasicyclic dynamics from the perspective of nonlinear time series analysis. Time series are generated with a predator-prey model whose prey's growth rate is driven by environmental noise. A method for the analysis of short and noisy data provides evidence for sensitivity to initial conditions, with a global Lyapunov exponent often close to zero characteristic of populations 'at the edge of chaos'. Results with methods restricted to long time series are consistent with a finite-dimensional attractor on which dynamics are sensitive to initial conditions. These results are compared with those previously obtained for quasicycles in an individual-based model with heterogeneous spatial distributions. Patterns of sensitivity to initial conditions are shown to differentiate phase-forgetting from phase-remembering quasicycles involving a periodic driver. The previously reported mode at zero of Lyapunov exponents in field and laboratory populations may reflect, in part, quasicyclic dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Epileptic seizures represent a sudden and transient change in the synchronised firing of neuronal brain ensembles. While the transition of the collective neuronal activity towards the ictal event is not well understood, some progress has been made using nonlinear time series analysis methods. We present here an analysis of the dynamical regimes of the epileptic activity in three patients suffering from intractable (drug-resistant) seizures, and compare these with the dynamics in rodent epilepsy models. We used the time interval between spikes found in the electroencephalographic recordings as our variable to construct interpeak interval (IPI) time delay plots to study the neuronal interictal (activity between seizures), preictal, and seizure activity. A one-dimensional mapping function was obtained by approximation of the IPI plots with a polynomial. Two main dynamical regimes are obtained from the analysis of the mapping function, derived from the subharmonic bifurcation present in the map: period doubling and intermittency, both of which are observed in human and rat seizures. Hence, our simple model obtained from experimental data captures essential phenomena for the collective dynamics of brain networks, that are found in recordings from human and animal epilepsies. The description of the neuronal dynamics based on one-dimensional maps, widely used in other systems, may prove useful for the understanding of the collective population dynamics of brain activity. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A detailed analysis of the anatomy of microcrystalline (mu c-Si) films deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition from both SiF4-H-2 and SiH4-H-2 mixtures is performed by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). Specifically, the mu c-Si film anatomy consists of an interface layer at the substrate/mu c-Si bulk layer, a bulk mu c-Si layer, and a surface porous layer. All these layers have their own microstructures, which need to be highlighted, since it is this overall anatomy which determines the optical properties of mu c-Si films. The ability of SE to discriminate the complex microstructure of mu c-Si thin films is emphasized also by the comparison with the x-ray diffraction data which cannot provide unambiguous information regarding the distribution of the crystalline and the amorphous phases along the mu c-Si film thickness. Through the description of the mu c-Si film anatomy, information on the effect of the growth precursors (SiF4 or SiH4) and of the substrate (c-Si or Corning glass) on the growth dynamics can be obtained. The key role of the F-atoms density and, therefore, of the etching-to-deposition competition on the growth mechanism and film microstructure is highlighted. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

abstract = {Traditional linear analysis in the time series has been routinely used but did not seem to successfully give insight into the characteristic and mechanism of time series because these methods are limited by the requirement of stationarity of the time series and normality and independence of the residuals. A new data processing technique, known as data mining, can overcome these problems and effectively draw off the hidden information in these large time series data sets. A new framework for analyzing time series data called Time Series Data Mining (TSDM) motivated us to adapt and innovate data mining concepts, dynamical approaches in chaos theory, and optimization techniques to the areas of time series analysis.    The main objective of this research is to provide new data mining concepts and a new set of methods, based on time series analysis, chaos theory and optimization techniques, that are able to characterize, draw inferences, and reveal hidden temporal patterns that are predictive characteristics of time series events. These tools can be used to develop a new technique for the prediction of the time series arising in real world problems, as well as to conduct advanced studies on the subject.    In this dissertation, analysis based on chaos theory and theory of nonlinear dynamics has been applied to time series data to identify complex (nonperiodic, nonlinear, irregular, and chaotic) characteristics. Several alternative optimization methods for reconstructing parameter spaces of the dynamcal systems and identifying predictive temporal patterns in the system are employed. Specifically, these problems can be formulated as multi-quadratic programming (MCP) problems. To solve MQP problems, a new linearization technique based on Karush-Kuhn Tucker optimality conditions, proven to guarantee the global optimality, is developed. A novel combination of methods for determining the optimal parameters and temporal patterns are applied to real-world electroencephalogram (EEG) time series for prediction of epileptic seizures. The results show that the combination of these techniques provides accurate results while improving dramatically the time required to quantify chaos in time series, and eliminating a range of parameters that have, thus far, been fixed empirically. Sensitivity analysis is employed to justify the use of this combination of methods, and comparisons are made with more conventional quantifying techniques and trivial measures showing the advantage of the results generated by this work.},

@article{RILK2003,
abstract = {The electroretinogram (ERG) is an essential method for diagnosing and monitoring hereditary eye diseases, because it allows an objective assessment of retinal function. However, high-level intrinsic electrical and physiological noise often interferes with the physiological signals of interest, rendering the results difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate, especially when the retinal function is already impoverished. For several years, nonlinear time series analysis has been applied to developing signal processing methods that rely on transforming a scalar sequence of measurements into a multidimensional vector space, known as "phase space". This transformation, or embedding, allows one to recover implicit information about the system of interest that is not accessible by analysis of the recorded scalar time series alone. Moreover, embeddings form a fundamental starting point for several mathematical-physical noise reduction (NR) algorithms that exploit the signal's nonlinear properties. Therefore, the application of such methods to the analysis of complex systems seems very promising, particularly when nonlinear behaviour is observed, as is the case for the voltage-time series comprising the ERG. Until now, however, the feasibility of applying such methods to the ERG has not been considered. The aims of this thesis were twofold: first, to investigate if embeddings themselves add meaningfully to the ERG's spectrum of conventional diagnostic parameters; and, second, to compare the performance of the new nonlinear NR methods with the NR techniques applied in conventional ERG diagnostics. To achieve this, a PC-operated diagnostic system, named CALYPSO, was developed to record ganzfeld ERGs and to analyze them by means of nonlinear time series analysis. The system is capable of creating and displaying embeddings as well as nonlinear filtering. Additionally, it can run the fast Fourier transform (FFT), finite impulse response (FIR) filtering, and standard averaging techniques. Using the system, 30 Hz flicker ERGs, measured according to the ISCEV standard, of 10 normal volunteers and 4 patients suffering from different hereditary retinal diseases were recorded. The scalar data were reconstructed in phase space by a time delay embedding and then analyzed by means of a newly developed topographic approach (Topographic Angles). For the data at hand, the Topographic Angles turned out to be a powerful marker for distinguishing between normal and pathological ERGs, independently of the diagnostic criteria employed in the ISCEV standard. Thus, Topographic Angles may be regarded as a potential addition to the currently available diagnostic methods. The second aim of this thesis was to evaluate nonlinear methods for recovering ERG signals. Nonlinear Projective Noise Reduction (NNR) is one example of such algorithms. It is independent of the frequency spectrum of the analyzed signal, which sets it apart from conventional methods like FFT or FIR filtering. NNR is therefore useful in eliminating broad-band noise, whose frequency spectrum closely resembles the spectrum of the signal of interest - a common problem in electrophysiology. The NNR algorithm was implemented in CALYPSO and its performance was evaluated by means of normal ERG data, which were contaminated by different types of artificially generated noise. The initial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the type of noise (white noise or spectrally matched noise) and the number of algorithm iterations were varied. The results were compared with results obtained by the classical methods of averaging and by FFT frequency filtering. A subsequent quantitative analysis revealed the advantages and disadvantages of each of the three methods. Averaging performs predictably, is stable and provides NR up to 7dB under the tested conditions, independently of the initial noise level. The FFT is very powerful at low initial SNR and provides NR up to 12dB, but produces severe artifacts at high initial SNR. The NNR performs intermediately, providing NR up to 8dB. In principle, it can even reduce noise whose frequency content is identical to that of the uncontaminated ERG data, which neither FFT nor FIR filtering is capable of. An additional bonus was that all three NR schemes may be combined beneficially without incurring severe redundancy effects. In fact, the three methods contribute fairly independent of each other to a total NR of some 15dB, which is much more than each can provide alone. Given these advantages, it seems very likely that the phase space representation, Topographic Angles and the NNR will contribute to our modern ophthalmalogical diagnostic tool set in the near future. The development of CALYPSO has been the first successful step. Further investigation is now warranted.},

We re-examined data on budmoth density, plant quality, and parasitism rates. Our results suggest that the effect of plant quality on budmoth density is weak. By contrast, a simple model of budmoth-parasitoid interaction accounts for 90{\%} of the variance in budmoth population growth rates. Thus, contrary to previous studies, we find that parasitoid-budmoth interaction appears to be the dominant factor driving the budmoth cycle.},

abstract = {The assumption that volcanic tremor may be generated by deterministic nonlinear source processes is now supported by a number of studies at different volcanoes worldwide that clearly demonstrate the low-dimensional nature of the phenomenon. We applied methods based on the theory of nonlinear dynamics to volcanic tremor events recorded at Sangay volcano, Ecuador in order to obtain more information regarding the physics of their source mechanism. The data were acquired during 21–26 April 1998 and were recorded using a sampling interval of 125 samples s 1 by two broadband seismometers installed near the active vent of the volcano. In a previous study JOHNSON and LEES (2000) classified the signals into three groups: (1) short duration ({\textless}1 min) impulses generated by degassing explosions at the vent; (2) extended degassing ‘chugging' events with a duration 2–5 min containing well-defined integer overtones (1–5 Hz) and variable higher frequency content; (3) extended degassing events that contain significant energy above 5 Hz. We selected 12 events from groups 2 and 3 for our analysis that had a duration of at least 90 s and high signal-to-noise ratios. The phase space, which describes the evolution of the behavior of a nonlinear system, was reconstructed using the delay embedding theorem suggested by Takens. The delay time used for the reconstruction was chosen after examining the first zero crossing of the autocorrelation function and the first minimum of the Average Mutual Information (AMI) of the data. In most cases it was found that both methods yielded a delay time of 14–18 samples (0.112–0.144 s) for group 2 and 5 samples (0.04 s) for group 3 events. The sufficient embedding dimension was estimated using the false nearest neighbors method which had a value of 4 for events in group 2 and was in the range 5–7 for events in group 3. Based on these embedding parameters it was possible to calculate the correlation dimension of the resulting attractor, as well as the average divergence rate of nearby orbits given by the largest Lyapunov exponent. Events in group 2 exhibited lower values of both the correlation dimension (1.8–2.6) and largest Lyapunov exponent (0.013–0.022) in comparison with the events in group 3 where the values of these quantities were in the range 2.4–3.5 and 0.029–0.043, respectively. Theoretically, a nonlinear oscillation described by the equation €xx þ b{\_}xx þ cgðxÞ ¼ f cosxt can generate deterministic signals with characteristics similar to those observed in groups 2 and 3 as the values of the parameters b; c; f ;x are drifting, causing instability of orbits in the phase space.},

Furthermore to support this claim fractal dimension (FD) analysis is performed. The results indicate reduction in value of FD for epileptic EEG indicating reduction in system complexity.},

The notion of predictability is relaxed from accurate prediction of individual trajectories to a coarse-grained view in which only probabilities of visiting certain regions of state space or regimes are forecast. The regimes and the transition probabilities between them are determined simultaneously by fitting a hidden Markov model to a time series of the system. Predictive information is then refined by building a nearest-neighbour model of the regime posterior distribution. The ideas are exemplified on the stochastically forced Lorenz system. {\textcopyright} EDP Sciences and Springer 2008.},

abstract = {Primary sensory neurons can generate irregular burst firings in which the existence of significant deterministic behaviors of chaotic dynamics has been proved with nonlinear time series analysis. But how well the deterministic characteristics and neural information of presynaptic chaotic spike trains were transmitted into postsynaptic spike trains is still an open question. Here we investigated the synaptic transmission of chaotic spike trains between primary A$\delta$ afferent fiber and spinal dorsal horn neuron. Two kinds of basic stimulus unit, brief burst and single pulse, were employed by us to comprise chaotic stimulus trains. For time series analysis, we defined "events" as the longest sequences of spikes with all interspike intervals less than or equal to a certain threshold and extracted the interevent intervals (IEIs) from spike trains. Return map analysis of the IEI series showed that the main temporal structure of chaotic input trains could be detected in postsynaptic output trains, especially under brief-burst stimulation. Using correlation dimension and nonlinear prediction methods, we found that synaptic transmission could influence the nonlinear characteristics of chaotic trains, such as fractal dimension and short-term predictability, with greater influence made under single-pulse stimulation. By calculating the mutual information between input and output trains, we found the information carried by presynaptic spike trains could not be completely transmitted at primary afferent synapses, and that brief bursts could more reliably transmit the information carried by chaotic input trains across synapses. These results indicate that although unreliability exists during synaptic transmission, the main deterministic characteristics of chaotic burst trains can be transmitted across primary afferent synapses. Moreover, brief bursts that come from the periphery can more reliably transmit neural information between primary afferent fibers and spinal dorsal horn neurons. {\textcopyright} 2004 IBRO.

abstract = {[1] This study establishes a series of tests to examine the relative utility of nonlinear time series analysis for oceanic data. The performance of linear autoregressive models and nonlinear delay coordinate embedding methods are compared for three numerical and two observational data sets. The two observational data sets are (1) an hourly near-bottom pressure time series from the South Atlantic Bight and (2) an hourly current-meter time series from the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB). The nonlinear methods give significantly better predictions than the linear methods when the underlying dynamics have low dimensionality. When the dimensionality is high, the utility of nonlinear methods is limited by the length and quality of the time series. On the application side we mainly focus on the MAB data set. We find that the slope velocities are much less predictable than shelf velocities. Predictability on the slope after several hours is no better than the statistical mean. On the other hand, significant predictability of shelf velocities can be obtained for up to at least 12 hours.

abstract = {Research on how multinational firms deal with home-host cultural differences argues that cultural differences are minimized and assumes that foreign cultures are homogenous. In this paper we relax the cultural homogeneity assumption. In the presence of cultural variation in host countries the minimization of cultural differences leads existing mean-based indices of cultural differences to overestimate the actual cultural differences these firms have to deal with. We test this argument in a 25-year panel analysis of total US multinationals' foreign sales in 54 host countries. At the sample average of cultural variation, the use of mean cultural difference indices yields a 74{\%} overestimate of the actual cultural difference effect. This suggests that home-host cultural differences are a substantially smaller barrier to multinational sales than hitherto assumed. The assumption of cultural homogeneity leads to conclusions in which a too large role is attributed to cultural differences. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In the current approach, we concentrate specifically on genes and intergenic regions. To estimate the level and type of correlation in these regions we apply various statistical methods inspired from nonlinear time series analysis, namely the probability distribution of tuplets, the Mutual Information and the Identical Neighbour Fit. The methods are suitably modified to work on symbolic sequences and they are first tested for validity on sequences obtained from well-known simple deterministic and stochastic models. Then they are applied to the DNA sequence of chromosome 1 of arabidopsis thaliana. The results suggest that correlations do exist in the DNA sequence but they are weak and that intergenic sequences tend to be more correlated than gene sequences. The use of statistical tests with surrogate data establish these findings in a rigorous statistical manner. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Such important mechanical systems exhibit interesting dynamic behaviors: homoclinic orbits; sub-harmonic responses; amplitude modulations and chaos. These dynamics have been obtained numerically and in some case have been experimentally observed. Using recent techniques of the Nonlinear Time Series analysis, the response of axially moving systems is studied for a large variety of test cases. The correlation dimension of the time series, which is deeply related to the minimal dimension of a system able to reproduce the dynamics, is estimated. Lyapunov exponents are evaluated in order to quantify the response regularity. The present work give a contribution in understanding complex dynamics observed both in conservative and dissipative systems. The dynamical phenomena are analyzed within the unified framework fo the Nonlinear Time Series Analysis. In the case of experimental data the new nonlinear filtering techniques, based on the embedding techniques, have been applied to reduce high noise when classical techniques give bad results.

abstract = {Background: The optimum treatment choice between initial highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with a protease inhibitor (PI) versus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) is uncertain. An indirect analysis reported that PI-based HAART was better than NNRTI-based HAART. However, direct evidence for competing interventions is deemed more reliable than indirect evidence for making treatment decisions. We did a meta-analysis of head-to-head trials and compared the results with those of indirect analyses. Methods: 12 trials of at least 24 weeks' duration directly compared NNRTI-based versus PI-based HAART in HIV-infected patients with limited or no previous exposure to antiretrovirals. We also identified six trials of NNRTI-based HAART and eight trials of PI-based HAART, each versus two NRTI regimens. We analysed the outcomes of virological suppression, death or disease progression, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Findings: In the direct meta-analysis, NNRTI-based regimens were better than PI-based regimens for virological suppression (OR 160, 95{\%} CI 131-196). The difference was reduced in higher-quality trials, but still favoured NNRTI-based HAART. There were no differences in death or disease progression (087, 056-135) or withdrawal because of adverse events (068, 043-108). By contrast, in indirect analyses NNRTI-based HAART was worse than PI-based HAART for virological suppression (026, 007-091). There were no significant differences for death or disease progression (128, 056-294) and withdrawals because of adverse events (146, 066-324). When trials of delavirdine were excluded, similar results were produced. Interpretation: Results from direct analyses suggested that NNRTI-based HAART was more effective than PI-based HAART for virological suppression and was similar to PI-based HAART for clinical outcomes. Indirect comparisons could be unreliable for complex and rapidly evolving interventions such as HAART. 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many complex and interesting phenomena in nature are due to nonlinear phenomena. The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called 'chaos theory', has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages. Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results in terms of 'functional sources' and 'functional networks' allows the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i) normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated with normal information processing, whereas both hyper - as well as hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing and disturbed consciousness. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

We use basic nonlinear time series analysis methods that are appropriate for undergraduate courses. Mutual information and false nearest neighbours are explained in detail, and used to obtain the best possible attractor reconstruction. For the reconstructed attractor, a determinism test is performed and the largest Lyapunov exponent is calculated. We show that the largest Lyapunov exponent is positive, which is a strong indicator for the chaotic behaviour of the system. To help the reader reproduce our results and to facilitate further applications on other experimental systems, we provide user-friendly programs with graphical interface for each implemented method on ourWeb page},

abstract = {The Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a representative signal containing information about the condition of the brain. The shape of the wave may contain useful information about the state of the brain. However, the human observer cannot directly monitor these subtle details. Besides, since bio-signals are highly subjective, the symptoms may appear at random in the time scale. Therefore, the EEG signal parameters, extracted and analyzed using computers, are highly useful in diagnostics. Chaotic measures like correlation dimension (CD), largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), Hurst exponent (H) and entropy are used to characterize the signal. Results indicate that these nonlinear measures are good discriminators of normal and epileptic EEG signals. These measures distinguish epileptic EEG and alcoholic from normal EEG with an accuracy of more than 90{\%}. The dynamical behavior is less random for alcoholic and epileptic compared to normal. This indicates less of information processing in the brain due to the hyper-synchronization of the EEG. Hence, the application of nonlinear time series analysis to EEG signals offers insight into the dynamical nature and variability of the brain signals. As a pre-analysis step, the EEG data is tested for nonlinearity using surrogate data analysis and the results exhibited a significant difference in the correlation dimension measure of the actual data and the surrogate data. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, under these circumstances standard cross-validation is no longer a satisfactory bandwidth selector because it is unduly influenced by extreme prediction errors caused by the existence of these outliers. A more robust method proposed here is a cross-validation method that discounts the extreme prediction errors. In large samples the robust method chooses consistent bandwidths, and the consistency of the method is practically independent of the form in which extreme prediction errors are discounted. Additionally, evaluation of the method's finite sample behavior in a simulation demonstrates that the proposed method performs favorably. This method can also be applied to other problems, for example, model selection, that require cross-validation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of studies have evaluated lumbar spinal muscle fatigue using the electromyography (EMG) signal. However, back muscle fatigue studies do not consistently report endurance levels for patients with or without low back pain (LBP). In this case report, we investigated a nonlinear analysis of EMG time series that characterizes their complexity. MATERIAL/METHODS: A 37-year-old male with chronic LBP and an age- and gender-matched volunteer were compared. The endurance of the erector spinae muscle was determined using a modified version of the isometric Sorensen fatigue test. Nonlinear time series analysis techniques reveal the presence of long-range, power-law correlations. After checking that the signal was stationary, the original time series of 60,000 entries was reduced to 6000 entries by averaging over 10 consecutive entries. RESULTS: There was a difference between the entropy time dependence exhibited by entropy time dependence exhibited by the healthy subject and the LBP subject. The entropy associated with the LBP subject saturates at very short-times--two orders of magnitude shorter than for the healthy subject. CONCLUSIONS: The characterization of the nonlinear time series in this case study provides a consistent measure of back muscle activities. It is important to understand the potential limitations before undertaking an EMG analysis in the field of ergonomics or biomechanics. Further studies are needed to investigate the characteristics of back muscles.},

abstract = {In time series analysis, it has been considered of key importance to determine whether a complex time series measured from the system is regular, deterministically chaotic, or random. Recently, Gottwald and Melbourne have proposed an interesting test for chaos in deterministic systems. Their analyses suggest that the test may be universally applicable to any deterministic dynamical system. In order to fruitfully apply their test to complex experimental data, it is important to understand the mechanism for the test to work, and how it behaves when it is employed to analyze various types of data, including those not from clean deterministic systems. We find that the essence of their test can be described as to first constructing a random walklike process from the data, then examining how the variance of the random walk scales with time. By applying the test to three sets of data, corresponding to i 1/ f noise with long-range correlations, ii edge of chaos, and iii weak chaos, we show that the test mis-classifies i both deterministic and weakly stochastic edge of chaos and weak chaos as regular motions, and ii strongly stochastic edge of chaos and weak chaos, as well as 1/ f noise as deterministic chaos. Our results suggest that, while the test may be effective to discriminate regular motion from fully developed deterministic chaos, it is not useful for exploratory purposes, especially for the analysis of experimental data with little a priori knowledge. A few speculative comments on the future of multiscale nonlinear time series analysis are made.},

abstract = {In this work, recent advances in the use of nonlinear time-series analysis for structural health monitoring are extended to incorporate multivariate data. Structural response data recorded at multiple locations are combined using a multivariate time delay embedding in order to reconstruct the structure's dynamical attractor. Using this approach, a global phase-space representation of the dynamics may be realized for spatially extended systems. A new attractor-based metric, chaotic amplification of attractor distortion (CAAD), is then introduced as a damage sensitive feature. The approach is implemented using data acquired from a composite beam, bolted at either end to steel plates. Degradation to the system is introduced as a loosening of the bolts at one end of the structure. Results based on multivariate attractor reconstruction show a clear ability to detect both the presence and magnitude of damage to the connection. Comparisons are then drawn between this approach and one where the same feature is extracted from attractors reconstructed using data acquired from the individual sensor locations. These features are combined "post-extraction" using a linear discriminant coordinant analysis. Performing the analysis separately at the individual sensor locations results in a significant reduction in discriminating power. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The potential use of a nonlinear deterministic framework for understanding the dynamic nature of solute transport processes in subsurface formations is investigated. Time series of solute particle transport in a heterogeneous aquifer medium, simulated using an integrated probability/Markov chain (TP/MC) model, groundwater flow model, and particle transport model, are studied. The correlation dimension method, a popular nonlinear time series analysis technique, is used to identify nonlinear determinism. Sensitivity of the solute transport dynamics to the four hydrostratigraphic parameters involved in the TP/MC model: (1) number of facies; (2) volume proportions of facies; (3) mean lengths (and thereby anisotropy ratio of mean length) of facies; and (4) juxtapositional tendencies (i.e. degree of entropy) among the facies is also studied. The western San Joaquin Valley aquifer system in California is considered as a reference system. The results indicate, in general, the nonlinear deterministic nature of solute transport dynamics (dominantly governed by only a very few variables, on the order of 3), even though more complex behavior is possible under certain (extreme) hydrostratigraphic conditions. The sensitivity analysis reveals: (1) the importance of the hydrostratigraphic parameters (in particular, volume proportions of facies and mean lengths) in representing aquifer heterogeneity; and (2) the ability of the correlation dimension method in capturing the (extent of) complexity of the underlying dynamics. Verification and confirmation of the present results through use of other nonlinear deterministic techniques and assessment of their reliability for a wide range of solute transport scenarios are recommended.},

One hundred and sixteen EEG-polygraphic recordings were performed on 55 neonatal subjects between 28 and 43 weeks gestational age from which state assignments were initially scored by visual analysis. A single channel of EEG (i.e., FP1-C3) was selected for dimensional analysis. Two-tailed t-tests were used to test for differences in the correlation dimension (CD) between active and quiet sleep states for both preterm and full-term neonates as a function of maturation. A significant difference in CD between active and quiet sleep states (P {\textless} 0.001) was noted for the full-term infant. A positive correlation between CD and increasing conceptional age was noted (P {\textless} 0.001). DA showed an increase in the complexity for both active and quiet sleep as the preterm infant matured toward a full-term corrected age. Lower dimensionality (CD), indicative of reduced complexity, was noted for the healthy preterm cohort at corrected full-term age when compared with the full-term group. Dimensional analysis demonstrated a positive correlation for both active and quiet sleep, as the infant matured toward corrected term age. Lower dimensionality was noted for the healthy preterm cohort at corrected full-term age. These findings support the concept of physiologic dysmaturity for the preterm neonate as a reflection of altered neural plasticity of the brain as a result of the conditions of prematurity.},

As compared to the linear models, the nonlinear time series models provide a much wider spectrum of possible dynamics for the economic time series data.

abstract = {Many complex and interesting phenomena in nature are due to nonlinear phenomena. The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called 'chaos theory', has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages. Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results in terms of 'functional sources' and 'functional networks' allows the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i) normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated with normal information processing, whereas both hyper - as well as hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing and disturbed consciousness. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Electromagnetic (EM) emission in a wide frequency spectrum ranging from very low frequencies (VLF) to very high frequencies (VHF) is produced by micro-cracks, which can be considered as the so-called precursors of general fracture. Herein we consider earthquakes (EQs) as large-scale fracture phenomena. We study the capability of nonlinear time series analysis to extract features from pre-seismic electromagnetic (EM) activity possibly indicating the nucleation of the impending EQ. In particular, we want to quantify and to visualize temporal changes of the complexity into consecutive time-windows of the time series. In this direction the original continuous time EM data is projected to a linguistic symbolic sequence and then we calculate the block entropies of the optimal partition. This analysis reveals a significant reduction of complexity of the underlying fracto-electromagnetic mechanism as the catastrophic events is approaching. We verify this result in terms of correlation dimension analysis. We point out that these findings are compatible with results from an independent linear method which uses a wavelet based approach for the estimation of fractal spectral characteristics. Field and laboratory experiments associate the epoch of low complexity in the tail of the precursory emission with the nucleation phase of the impending earthquake.},

Research has already shown that some dynamic systems and experimental models still cannot provide a good nonlinear analysis of turbulent time series because in the real turbulent flow there exist very complicated nonlinear behaviors affected by many vague factors. An approach of fuzzy piecewise regression analysis has been proposed to predict the nonlinear time series of turbulent flows. In this paper, we propose kernel interval regression machine for nonlinear time series analysis of turbulent flows. The proposed method applies the kernel trick to interval regression analysis in terms of the inner products of input vectors. In order to indicate the performance of this method, we present an example of predicting the near-wall turbulence time series as a verifiable model. Furthermore, we compare this method with fuzzy piecewise regression model. Experimental results show that the proposed method is very attractive for the turbulence time series in nonlinear analysis and in fuzzy environments. {\textcopyright} World Scientific Publishing Company.},

The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called 'chaos theory', has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages.

We present a step-by-step study of a simple example and provide user-friendly programs that allow an easy reproduction of presented results. In particular, we study an artificial time series generated by the Lorenz system. The mutual information and false nearest neighbour method are explained in detail, and used to obtain the best possible attractor reconstruction. Subsequently, the times series is tested for stationarity and determinism, which are both important properties that assure correct inter-pretation of invariant quantities that can be extracted from the data set. Finally, as the most prominent invariant quantity that allows distinguishing between regular and chaotic behaviour, we calculate the maximal Lyapunov exponent. By following the above steps, we are able to convincingly determine that the Lorenz system is chaotic directly from the generated time series, without the need to use the dif-ferential equations. Throughout the paper, emphasis on clear-cut guidance and a hands-on approach is given in order to make the reproduction of presented results possible also for undergraduates, and thus encourage them to get familiar with the presented theory.},

A GPDM comprises a low-dimensional latent space with associated dynamics, and a map from the latent space to an observation space. We marginalize out the model parameters in closed-form, using Gaussian Process (GP) priors for both the dynamics and the observation mappings. This results in a nonparametric model for dynamical systems that accounts for uncertainty in the model. We demonstrate the approach on human motion capture data in which each pose is 62-dimensional. Despite the use of small data sets, the GPDM learns an effective representation of the nonlinear dynamics in these spaces. Webpage:},

abstract = {This chapter discusses formal quantitative algorithms that can be used to identify business cycle turning points. An intuitive, graphical derivation of these algorithms is presented along with a description of how they can be implemented making very minimal distributional assumptions. We also provide the intuition and detailed description of these algorithms for both simple parametric univariate inference as well as latent-variable multiple-indicator inference using a state-space Markov-switching approach. We illustrate the promise of this approach by reconstructing the inferences that would have been generated if parameters had to be estimated and inferences drawn based on data as they were originally released at each historical date. Our recommendation is that one should wait until one extra quarter of GDP growth is reported or one extra month of the monthly indicators released before making a call of a business cycle turning point. We introduce two new measures for dating business cycle turning points, which we call the “quarterly real-time GDP-based recession probability index” and the “monthly real-time multiple-indicator recession probability index” that incorporate these principles. Both indexes perform quite well in simulation with real-time data bases. We also discuss some of the potential complicating factors one might want to consider for such an analysis, such as the reduced volatility of output growth rates since 1984 and the changing cyclical behavior of employment. Although such refinements can improve the inference, we nevertheless recommend the simpler specifications which perform very well historically and may be more robust for recognizing future business cycle turning points of unknown character.},

abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics provides a complementary framework to control theory for the quantitative analysis of the oculomotor control system. This paper presents a number of findings relating to the aetiology and mechanics of the pathological ocular oscillation jerk congenital nystagmus (jerk CN). A range of time series analysis techniques were applied to recorded jerk CN waveforms, and also to simulated jerk waveforms produced by an established model in which the oscillations are a consequence of an unstable neural integrator. The results of the analysis were then interpreted within the framework of a generalised model of the unforced oculomotor system.This work suggests that for jerk oscillations, the origin of the instability lies in one of the five oculomotor subsystems, rather than in the final common pathway (the neural integrator and muscle plant). Additionally, experimental estimates of the linearised foveation dynamics imply that a refixating fast phase induced by a near-homoclinic trajectory will result in periodic oscillations. Local dimension calculations show that the dimension of the experimental jerk CN data increases during the fast phase, indicating that the oscillations are not periodic, and hence that the refixation mechanism is of greater complexity than a homoclinic reinjection. The dimension increase is hypothesised to result either from a signal-dependent noise process in the saccadic system, or the activation of additional oculomotor components at the beginning of the fast phase. The modification of a recent saccadic system model to incorporate biologically realistic signal-dependent noise is suggested, in order to test the first of these hypotheses.},

The method is based on the idea of phase space warping, which refers to the small distortions in the fast subsystem's phase space that results from the slow drift, and uses short-time reference model prediction error as its primary measurement of this phenomenon. The basic theory is presented and the issues associated with its implementation in a practical algorithm are discussed. A vector-tracking version of the procedure, based on smooth orthogonal decomposition analysis, is applied to the study of a nonlinear vibrating beam experiment in which a crack propagates to complete fracture. Our method shows that the damage evolution is governed by a scalar process, and we are able to give real-time estimates of the current damage state and identify the governing damage evolution model. Using a final recursive estimation step based on this model, the time to failure is continuously and accurately predicted well in advance of actual failure.},

A new method of obtaining the energy distribution with time and frequency of transformer's core vibration based on Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) was developed. Firstly, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) separated the vibration series into a finite and small number of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). IMF was directly decomposed from vibration series and could reflect the intrinsic physical property of vibration series more clearly. Secondly, Hilbert transform was applied to every IMF. Then, three dimensional amplitude(energy)-frequency-time spectrum designated as Hilbert spectrum was got, where both amplitude and frequency were functions of time. The Hilbert spectrum eliminated the spurious harmonics without physical mean and provided high-resolution time-frequency characteristics of core's different work states, the test results show core vibration characteristics. It is demonstrated that the new detection method is one effective way for fault diagnosis of transformer's core},

abstract = {An advanced characterization of the complicated dynamical system brain is one of science's biggest challenges. Nonlinear time series analysis allows characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in which low-dimensional nonlinearity gives rise to complex and irregular behavior. While several studies indicate that nonlinear methods can extract valuable information from neuronal dynamics, others doubt their necessity and conjecture that the same information can be obtained using classical linear techniques. To address this issue, we compared these two concepts, but included furthermore a combination of nonlinear measures with surrogates, an approach that has been designed to specifically focus on nonlinearity. As a benchmark we used the discriminative power to detect the seizure-generating hemisphere in medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We analyzed intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from the seizure-free interval of 29 patients. While the performance of both linear and nonlinear measures was weak, if not insignificant, a very high performance was obtained by the use of surrogate-corrected measures. Focusing on nonlinearity by using a combination of nonlinear measures with surrogates appears as the key to a successful characterization of the spatial distribution of the epileptic process. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The aims of present study were to estimate the system complexity across the cortical layers by analyzing intracortical EEG signals using a nonlinear analytical method, and to identify how layer-related complexity varies with the alteration of thalamic input and brain state. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized under l{\%} halothane. Sixteen channels of evoked or spontaneous EEG signals were recorded simultaneously across the six cortical layers in the somatosensory cortex with a single Michigan probe. The system complexity was assessed by computing correlation dimension, D2, based on the Nonlinear Time Series Analysis data analysis program. Cortical layer IV exhibited a D2 value, 3.24, that was significantly higher than that of the other cortical layers. The D2 values in layers IV and II/III were significantly reduced after reversible deactivation of the ventral posterior lateral thalamic nucleus. D2 decreased with increases in administered halothane concentration from 0.75{\%} to 2.0{\%}, particularly in layer IV. The present findings suggest that cortical layer IV maintains a higher complexity than the other layers and that the complexity of the mid-cortical layers is subject to regulation from specific thalamic inputs and more sensitive to changes in the general state of brain excitation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Our framework uses these extensions to aid alignment of spatio-temporal sub-models (hypotheses) to empirical data - for example, satellite images plus remote-sensing - and to explore behaviours consistent with this alignment. The novel aspect of the work is a mechanism for linking global and local dynamics using a holistic spatio-temporal feedback loop. An example framework is devised for an urban planning application, transit-oriented developments, and its feasibility is demonstrated with real data.},

Main objective is to investigate its usefulness in the assessment of elderly walking. The method consists of a measurement of three-dimensional acceleration of the upper body and an estimation of the Lyapunov exponents, thereby directly quantifying local dynamic stability while walking. The proposed method demonstrates the effects and efficacies of the interventions for the elderly. The experimental results suggested that the method was useful in revealing the degree of improvements on the walking stability.

abstract = {The literature on geophysical time-series analysis is so extensive that to review even one topic, such as volcanic tremor series, is a major task (e.g. Konstantinou {\&} Schlindwein 2002). The purpose of this paper is not to attempt such a review but rather to outline some new tools for nonstationary and nonlinear time-series analysis that have been developed and used successfully in other areas of the environmental sciences and appear to have good potential for application in a volcanological or wider geophysical context. These stochastic methods of time-series analysis have the advantage that they all exploit powerful recursive (sequential updating) methods of estimation that facilitate the analysis of data generated by nonstationary and nonlinear systems (e.g. Young 1984). This paper starts by reviewing briefly some of the model-based methods of time-series analysis, signal extraction and forecasting that have appeared in the statistical and time-series analysis literature over many years and then proceeds to describe in more detail one approach that has attracted considerable interest over the past two decades. This is based on the concept of an ‘unobserved component' model and it exploits recursive estimation for the purposes of estimating time-variable parameters in nonstationary systems. It is shown that such an approach allows for various, practically useful procedures in time-series analysis: signal extraction; interpolation over gaps in time series; and forecasting or backcasting. It then goes on to outline the basic aspects of input-output time series modelling, considering both discrete-time and continuous-time ‘transfer function' models that.},

All measures are computed on successive segments of multichannel EEG windows selected from early, intermediate and late preictal states from four epochs. Hypothesis tests applied for each channel and epoch showed good discrimination of the preictal states and allowed for the selection of optimal measures. These optimal measures, together with other standard measures (skewness, kurtosis, largest Lyapunov exponent) formed the feature set for feature-based clustering and the feature-subset selection procedure showed that the best preictal state classification was obtained with the same optimal features. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract = {Abstract Software reliability growth models attempt to forecast the future reliability of a software system, based on observations of the historical occurrences of failures. This allows management to estimate the failure rate of the system in field use, and to set release criteria based on these forecasts. However, the current software reliability growth models have never proven to be accurate enough for widespread industry use. One possible reason is that the model forms themselves may not accurately capture the underlying process of fault injection in software; it has been suggested that fault injection is better modeled as a chaotic process rather than a random one. This possibility, while intriguing, has not yet been evaluated in large-scale, modern software reliability growth datasets. We report on an analysis of four software reliability growth datasets, including ones drawn from the Android and Mozilla open-source software communities. These are the four largest software reliability growth datasets we are aware of in the public domain, ranging from 1200 to over 86,000 observations. We employ the methods of nonlinear time series analysis to test for chaotic behavior in these time series; we find that three of the four do show evidence of such behavior (specifically, a multifractal attractor). Finally, we compare a deterministic time series forecasting algorithm against a statistical one on both datasets, to evaluate whether exploiting the apparent chaotic behavior might lead to more accurate reliability forecasts.},

abstract = {Evidence suggests that dab and rainbow trout are able to quickly adjust their food intake to an appropriate level when offered novel diets. In addition day-to-day and meal-to-meal food intake varies greatly and meal timing is plastic. Why this is the case is not clear: Food intake in fish is influenced by many factors, however the hierarchy and mechanisms by which these interact is not yet fully understood. A model of food intake may be helpful to understand these phenomena; to determine model type it is necessary to understand the qualitative nature of food intake. Food intake can be regarded as an autoregressive (AR) time series, as the amount of food eaten at time t will be influenced by previous meals, and this allows food intake to be considered using time series analyses. Here, time series data were analysed using nonlinear techniques to obtain qualitative information from which evidence for the hierarchy of mechanisms controlling food intake may be drawn. Time series were obtained for a group of dab and individuals and a group of rainbow trout for analysis. Surrogate data sets were generated to test several null hypotheses describing linear processes and all proved significantly different to the real data, suggesting nonlinear dynamics. Examination of topography and recurrence diagrams suggested that all series were deterministic and non-stationary. The point correlation dimension (PD2i) suggested low-dimensional dynamics. Our findings suggest therefore that any model of appetite should create output that is deterministic, non-stationary, low-dimensional and having nonlinear dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These algorithms include some methods for feature extraction, spectral mixture analysis, and spatial analysis. The linear assumption, however, may not be realistic since there are factors that may introduce nonlinearities during the formulation of hyperspectral imagery. The existence of nonlinearity has a negative impact on the effectiveness and accuracy of information extraction. In this study, we propose a method to investigate the existence of nonlinearity in hyperspectral data, represented by a 4m AVIRIS image acquired over an area of coastal forests on Vancouver Island. The proposed method is based on a statistical test using surrogate data, an approach originally introduced in nonlinear time series analysis. High-order autocorrelations are used as the discriminating statistic to evaluate the differences between the hyperspectral data and their surrogates. Instead of conducting a statistical test in time domain as is used in typical time series analysis, we did it in spatial and spectral domains. The investigation revealed that the existence of nonlinearity in hyperspectral data is evident in spectral domain, but not in the spatial domain.},

We capture the dynamics by analysing a recording of the singing activity. First, we reconstruct the phase space from the sound recording and test it against determinism and stationarity. After confirming determinism and stationarity, we show that the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the series is positive, which is a strong indicator for the chaotic behaviour of the system. We discuss that methods of nonlinear time series analysis can yield instructive insights and foster the understanding of acoustic communication among insects.},

abstract = {Constructing simpler models, either stochastic or deterministic, for exploring the phenomenon of flow reversals in fluid systems is in vogue across disciplines. Using direct numerical simulations and nonlinear time series analysis, we illustrate that the basic nature of flow reversals in convecting fluids can depend on the dimensionless parameters describing the system. Specifically, we find evidence of low-dimensional behavior in flow reversals occurring at zero Prandtl number, whereas we fail to find such signatures for reversals at infinite Prandtl number. Thus, even in a single system, as one varies the system parameters, one can encounter reversals that are fundamentally different in nature. Consequently, we conclude that a single general low-dimensional deterministic model cannot faithfully characterize flow reversals for every set of parameter values.},

The aircraft panels are modelled as thin orthotropic plates and their vibration response is simulated using FE modelling. The vibration response of a thin aluminium panel is simulated using FE modelling. The first ten resonant frequencies are estimated for the FE model and for the dynamically tested panel. They were found to show somewhat low sensitivity to damage. Then the simulated vibration response of the panel is transformed and expanded in a new phase space. This presents an alternative way to study and analyse the dynamics of a structure. A two dimensional phase space is used in this investigation. Thus instead of studying the single dimension measured vibration characteristics one is faced with expanded two dimensional variables which can be visualised and this facilitates the comparison between the damaged and the non-damage states.},

Early detection of motor faults results in fast unscheduled maintenance. In this study, a new artificial immune based support vector machine algorithm is proposed for fault diagnosis of induction motors. Support vector machines (SVMs) have become one of the most popular classification methods in soft computing, recently. However, classification accuracy depends on kernel and penalty parameters. Artificial immune system has abilities of learning, memory and self adaptive control. The kernel and penalizes parameters of support vector machine are tuned using artificial immune system. The training data of support vector machine are extracted from three phase motor current. The new feature vector is constructed based on park's vector approach. The phase space of this feature vector is constructed using nonlinear time series analysis. Broken rotor bar and stator short circuit faults are classified in combined phase space using support vector machines. The experimental data are taken from a three phase induction motor. One, two and three broken rotor bar faults and 10{\%} short circuit of stator faults are detected successfully.},

First, we introduce the concepts of dynamical (deterministic) chaos and fractional Brownian motion. Next, we discuss appropriate methods-fluctuation analysis and nonlinear time series analysis-for treatment of erratic time series based on these concepts. We outline some pitfalls and problems in the application of the discussed methods to empirical data.

abstract = {In a smooth input/output process y = f (x), if the input data x ∈ Rdis noise free and only the output data y is corrupted by noise, then a near optimal smooth model over(g, ̂) will be a close approximation to f. However, as previously observed, for example in [H. Kantz, T. Schreiber, Nonlinear Time Series Analysis, 2nd ed., Cambridge Univ. Press, 2004], if the input data is also corrupted by noise then this is no longer the case. With noise on the inputs, the best predictive smooth model based on noisy data need not be an approximation to the actual underlying process; rather, the best predictive model depends on both the underlying process and the noise. A corollary of this observation is that one cannot readily infer the nature of a process from noisy data. Since almost all data has associated noise this conclusion has some unsettling implications. In this note we show how these effects can be quantified using the Gamma test. In particular we examine the Gamma test analysis of noisy time series data. We show that the noise level on the best predictive smooth model (based on the noisy data) can be much higher than the noise level on individual time series measurements, and we give an upper bound for the first in terms of the second. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The dimension of the anesthesia strange attractor can be thought of as a measure of the degrees of freedom or the ;complexity' of the dynamics at different hypnotic levels. The results imply that for awaked state the correlation dimension is high, On the other hand, for light, moderate and deep hypnotic states these values decrease respectively; which means for anesthetized situation we expect lower correlation dimension.},

abstract = {Predictive modeling of natural resources has long relied on mechanistic descriptions incorporating various population attributes and to a lesser extent environmental conditions. A radical departure from this tradition is proposed, advocating the data-driven analysis and forecasting of population cycles from historical records, and using the Atlantic white shrimp, Litopenaeus setiferus, as a case study. The time series data were collected in the Charleston Harbor (32°4700N, 79°5600W), South Carolina, USA, and from the database of the National Marine Fisheries Service (http://www.st.nmfs.gov/st1/commercial/index.html), for the period between January 1986 and December 2004. Correlations between shrimp population cycles and environmental hydrological parameters were established by phase space reconstruction, a technique central to most nonlinear time series analysis methods. Predictive models of future shrimp population levels were built using feedforward artiWcial neural networks, a well-known machine learning technique. From several attempted strategies, predicting the state commercial harvest from the sampling of populations in the Charleston Harbor conducted by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources proved to be optimal, with an accuracy of 92{\%} for 1-month and 79{\%} for 3-month ahead predictions, as measured by the nonparametric and nonlinear Spearman's correlation coeYcient. In addition, the shrimp population levels seem to be more sensitively to changes in surface water temperature than salinity, but the latter is also an important consideration. These models also suggest that catch-per-unit-eVort data are important indicators of commercial harvest and, thus, provide an important linkage between monitoring programs and commercial returns, enabling accurate predictions of natural resources to be made in near real time and extended beyond the critical time frames within which resource managers operate.},

abstract = {The multiple sequence alignment problem is one of the im-portant problems in Genome Informatics. The notable fea-ture of this problem is that its state-space forms a lattice. Researchers have applied search algorithms such as A* and memory-bounded search algorithms including SNC to this problem. Unfortunately, previous work could align only seven sequences at most. Korf proposed DCBDS, which ex-ploits the features of a grid, and suggested that DCBDS prob-ably solved this problem, effectively. We found, however, that DCBDS was not effective for aligning many sequences. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective search algo-rithm, A* with Partial Expansion, for state-spaces with large branching factors. The aim of this algorithm is to store only necessary nodes for finding an optimal solution. In node ex-pansion, A* stores all child nodes, while our algorithm stores only promising child nodes. This mechanism enables us to re-duce the memory requirements during a search. We apply our algorithm to the multiple sequence alignment problem. It can align seven sequences with only 4.7{\%} of the stored nodes re-quired by A*.},

abstract = {Usually, in dealing with the dynamical behavior of noise from an industrial process (NFIP), random or even white noise is assumed to describe it. However, since white noise is just an ideal model in mathematics and can hardly exist in an industrial process, this assumption seriously hinders the successful application of classical control theory in practice. For this reason, nonlinear time series analysis is used to analyze NFIP in an attempt to capture the signature of chaos. The chaotic behavior is apparent in NFIP due to the presence of finite and non-integer correlation dimension, and the minimum number of macroscopic variables required to model NFIP dynamics is obtained. These results indicate that NFIP is deterministic and high-dimensional chaos but not random or white noise and, in the future, might lead the way towards the direct solution of prediction and modeling of NFIP and a series of changes to the traditional algorithms in the control field may appear.},

abstract = {Evidence suggests that dab and rainbow trout are able to quickly adjust their food intake to an appropriate level when offered novel diets. In addition day-to-day and meal-to-meal food intake varies greatly and meal timing is plastic. Why this is the case is not clear: Food intake in fish is influenced by many factors, however the hierarchy and mechanisms by which these interact is not yet fully understood. A model of food intake may be helpful to understand these phenomena; to determine model type it is necessary to understand the qualitative nature of food intake. Food intake can be regarded as an autoregressive (AR) time series, as the amount of food eaten at time t will be influenced by previous meals, and this allows food intake to be considered using time series analyses. Here, time series data were analysed using nonlinear techniques to obtain qualitative information from which evidence for the hierarchy of mechanisms controlling food intake may be drawn. Time series were obtained for a group of dab and individuals and a group of rainbow trout for analysis. Surrogate data sets were generated to test several null hypotheses describing linear processes and all proved significantly different to the real data, suggesting nonlinear dynamics. Examination of topography and recurrence diagrams suggested that all series were deterministic and non-stationary. The point correlation dimension (PD2i) suggested low-dimensional dynamics. Our findings suggest therefore that any model of appetite should create output that is deterministic, non-stationary, low-dimensional and having nonlinear dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There is a growing body of evidence that the nonlinear structure of human movement patterns is related to how the nervous system is organized for controlling movement. Reliable models that closely resemble the nonlinear dynamics of human movement are required to advance our knowledge in this field. These models will accelerate our understanding of the nature of nonlinear movement patterns, and will provide meaningful predictions of which neuromechancial variables govern the observed nonlinear dynamics. Previously we have successfully used passive dynamic walking computer models to make predictions about how the neuromechanics of the locomotive system influence the nonlinear gait patterns of humans. These computer models have inspired us to explore whether a physical passive dynamic walking robot can also exhibit a deterministic nonlinear gait pattern. Recently, we have built a simple passive dynamic walking robot that is capable of a long-term walking pattern on a slightly inclined treadmill that operates in reverse. We used a high speed three-dimensional motion capture system to evaluate the limb kinematics of the robot's gait. Nonlinear time series analysis techniques were used to determine the time lag, embedding dimension and Theiler's window for proper reconstruction of the robot's gait dynamics. The Lyapunov exponent (LyE) was calculated for the leg angle time series to evaluate the structure of the nonlinear variations present in the robot's gait, and a pseudo-periodic surrogate analysis was conducted to determine whether the variations in the robot's gait pattern were stochastic or deterministic. Our results indicate that our passive dynamic robot has a deterministic nonlinear gait pattern that may be chaotic. This walking robot is the first of its kind and will provide a new scientific platform for testing the variables that govern the nonlinear gait dynamics. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

abstract = {The phenomenon of roundoff-error propagation is a well known problem in computations involving floating point arithmetic. Prominent works in the field of error analysis include (1) the error-analysis based on differential error-propagation model for computer algebra system (CAS), (2) the identification and reformulation of instability in a code generated by CAS, (3) estimating the bounds on errors in symbolic and numerical environments. The main concern in these attempts is to control error-propagation by using numerically stable code. Beside these attempts, only few efforts are made towards the theoretical understanding of the underlying process of error propagation. In this paper, we attempt to show that the roundoff-errors may propagate as a random-fractal process. We apply concepts of nonlinear time-series analysis on a series constituting successive roundoff-errors generated during the computation of Henon-map solutions. We estimate the correlation dimension, which is a measure of the fractal dimension, of the series as 5.5 ±0.05. This low value of correlation dimension shows that the error series can be modeled by a low dimensional dynamical system. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

Recently, we have used nonlinear time-series analysis to analyze the light curve of 3C 273 and found its eccentric behavior may be chaos L. Liu, Chin. J. Astron. Astrophys. textbf6, 663 (2006). This result induces us to look for some nonlinear mechanism to explain the eccentric luminosity variation.

Then we compute the outburst energy triangle F, defined as the difference of the maximum luminosity and the minimum luminosity, and the mean luminosity . We find that triangle Fsim alpha in the chaotic domain, where alphaapprox 1. In this domain, we also find that sim M 0.5, where M is the mass of central black hole.

The model comprises hidden layers of state-space or dynamic causal models, arranged so that the output of one provides input to another. The ensuing hierarchy furnishes a model for many types of data, of arbitrary complexity. Special cases range from the general linear model for static data to generalised convolution models, with system noise, for nonlinear time-series analysis. Crucially, all of these models can be inverted using exactly the same scheme, namely, dynamic expectation maximization. This means that a single model and optimisation scheme can be used to invert a wide range of models. We present the model and a brief review of its inversion to disclose the relationships among, apparently, diverse generative models of empirical data. We then show that this inversion can be formulated as a simple neural network and may provide a useful metaphor for inference and learning in the brain.},

This paper focuses on estimating self-affined nature of nonlinearity of ground-level peak ozone time series, which is analyzed by two nonlinear fractal statistical methods, including R/S analysis and BDS test. To explore the underlying structure of ozone observations at ground level and improve the forecasting capacity in urban region, practical implementation was assessed by a case study via collecting and analyzing the monitoring data at Chaojhou and Zenwu in the Kaohsiung metropolitan region, Taiwan. Based on R/S analysis, the time series can be identified as persistent and long-memory processes with Hurst exponents of both about 0.75. In addition, the V statistics specifies possible fluctuation cycle lengths of 32, 170, and 420 day simultaneously. Such results are consistent with the regional meteorological conditions leading to help characterize the regional scale ozone behavioral trend. Furthermore, the BDS test results confirm a strong nonlinearity of both time series associated with these two cities. Yet in both cases, nonlinearity implies chaos. The R/S analysis and BDS test provide strong evidence for nonlinearity and fractality of ozone time series due to noisy chaos, and we could not rule out the possibility of deterministic chaos in tropospheric ozone system. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The predictability of silicon sequences conversely renders a strong indication of the presence of a deterministic mechanism ruling the dynamics of the ironmaking blast furnace process. In the meantime, the results also provide important information on selecting the minimum number of macroscopic variables and the delay time needed for reconstructing the dynamics of these blast furnace systems. Moreover, the above information is found to be independent of the size of these blast furnaces. However, there is a slight difference in the complexity of the silicon sequence collected from different types of blast furnaces. As one might expect, larger difficulty will be encountered in predicting the silicon content of a pint-sized blast furnace because of the presence of the larger complexity.},

One of the methods uses the statistical distribution of state space points on the attractor of a vibrating structure, while the other one is based on the Poincar{\'{e}} map of the state space projected dynamic response. In this paper both methods are developed and demonstrated for a thin vibrating plate. The investigation is based on finite element modelling of the plate vibration response. The results obtained demonstrate the influence of damage on the local dynamic attractor of the plate state space and the applicability of the proposed strategies for damage assessment.

Nonlinear time series analysis (NTSA) is used to investigate deterministic chaos. However, most ecological time series are too short to perform NTSA, which usually requires a time series whose size is in the thousands. Here we propose a way to reconstruct local dynamics from a very short ecological time series whose data point is smaller than ten. For most tree crops such as citrus, nuts and acorns, the yield alternates between high- and low-bearing years. Isagi et al. [Isagi Y, Sugimura K, Sumida A, Ito H.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Comparisons of spontaneous movements of premature infants with brain injuries and those without brain injuries can provide insights into normal and abnormal processes in the ontogeny of motor development. In this study, the characteristics of spontaneous upper-extremity movements of premature infants with brain injuries and those without brain injuries were examined with time series analysis. SUBJECTS: Participants were 7 premature infants with brain injuries and 7 matched, low-risk, premature infants at the age of 1 month after term. METHODS: A triaxial accelerometer was used to measure upper-extremity limb acceleration in 3-dimensional space. Acceleration signals were recorded from the right wrist when the infant was in an active, alert state and lying in the supine position. The recording time was 200 seconds. The acceleration signal was sampled at a rate of 200 Hz. The acceleration time series data were analyzed by nonlinear analysis as well as linear analysis. RESULTS: The nonlinear time series analysis indicated that spontaneous movements of premature infants have nonlinear, chaotic, dynamic characteristics. The movements of the infants with brain injuries were characterized by larger dimensionality, and they were more unstable and unpredictable than those of infants without brain injuries. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: As determined by nonlinear analysis, the spontaneous movements of the premature infants with brain injuries had the characteristics of increased disorganization compared with those of the infants without brain injuries. Infants with brain injuries may manifest problems with self-organization as a function of the coordination of subsystems. Physical therapists should be able to support interactions among the subsystems and promote self-organization of motor learning through the individualized provision of various sensorimotor experiences for infants},

abstract = {Whether or not the human cardiac system is chaotic has long been a subject of interest in the application of nonlinear time series analysis. The surrogate data method, which identifies an observed time series against three common kinds of hypotheses, does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm the existence of deterministic chaotic dynamics in cardiac time series, such as electrocardiogram data and pulse pressure propagation data. Moreover, these methods fail to exclude all but the most trivial hypothesis of linear noise. We present a recently suggested fourth algorithm for testing the hypotheses of a noise driven periodic orbit to decide whether these signals are consistent with deterministic chaos. Of course, we cannot exclude all other alternatives but our test is certainly stronger than the those applied previously. The algorithmic complexity is used as the discriminating statistic of the surrogate data method. We then perform nonlinear modeling for the short-term prediction between ECG and pulse data to provide further evidence that they conform to deterministic processes. We demonstrate the application of these methods to human electrocardiogram recordings and blood pressure propagation in the fingertip of seven healthy subjects. Our results indicate that bounded aperiodic determinism exists in both ECG and pulse time series. The addition of (the inevitable) dynamic noise means that it is not possible to conclude the underlying system is chaotic.},

abstract = {Calcium has been established as a key messenger in both intra- and intercellular signaling. Experimentally observed intracellular calcium responses to different agonists show a variety of behaviors from simple spiking to complex oscillatory regimes. Here we study typical experimental traces of calcium oscillations in hepatocytes obtained in response to phenylephrine and ATP. The traces were analyzed with methods of nonlinear time series analysis in order to determine the stochastic/deterministic nature of the intracellular calcium oscillations. Despite the fact that the oscillations appear, visually, to be deterministic yet perturbed by noise, our analyses provide strong evidence that the measured calcium traces in hepatocytes are prevalently of stochastic nature. In particular, bursting calcium oscillations are temporally correlated Gaussian series distorted by a monotonic, instantaneous, time-independent function, whilst the spiking behavior appears to have a dynamical nonlinear component whereby the overall determinism level is still low. The biological importance of this finding is discussed in relation to the mechanisms incorporated in mathematical models as well as the role of stochasticity and determinism at cellular and tissue levels which resemble typical statistical and thermodynamic effects in physics. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We examine experimentally a chemical system in a flow-through stirred reactor, which is known to provide large-amplitude oscillations of the pH value. By systematic variation of the flow rate, we find that the system displays hysteresis between a steady state and oscillations, and more interestingly, a transition to chaos involving mixed-mode oscillations. The basic pattern of the measured pH in the mixed-mode regime includes a large-scale peak followed by a series of oscillations on a much smaller scale, which are usually highly irregular and of variable duration. The bifurcation diagram shows that chaos sets in via a period-doubling route observed on the large-amplitude scale, but simultaneously small-amplitude oscillations are involved. Beyond the apparent accumulation of period doubling bifurcations, a mixed-mode regime with irregular oscillations on both scales is observed, occasionally interrupted by windows of periodicity. As the flow rate is further increased, chaos turns into quasiperiodicity and later to a simple small-amplitude periodic regime. Dynamics of selected typical regimes were examined with the tools of nonlinear time-series analysis, which include phase space reconstruction of an attractor and calculation of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. The analysis points to deterministic chaos, which appears via a period doubling route from below and via a route involving quasiperiodicity from above, when the flow rate is varied.},

Low and high frequency noises in car brakes, often referred to as brake squeal, are known to be a result of nonlinearity, unstable behaviour and bifurcations leading to limit cycle behaviour. By using the data from a separate experimental study designed to determine the influence of the geometric parameters of brake pads (such as the number and location of slots) on brake squeal noise, we examine two new approaches for providing improved understanding of the brake squeal phenomenon: statistical and nonlinear dynamics analyses. Results of the statistical analysis indicate that the performances of certain pad designs correlate with their levels of nonlinearity. The nonlinear time series analysis reveals that, in the experimental data, not only are limit cycle behaviours present but also a route to chaotic solutions can be observed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Comparisons of spontaneous movements of premature infants with brain injuries and those without brain injuries can provide insights into normal and abnormal processes in the ontogeny of motor development. In this study, the characteristics of spontaneous upper-extremity movements of premature infants with brain injuries and those without brain injuries were examined with time series analysis. SUBJECTS: Participants were 7 premature infants with brain injuries and 7 matched, low-risk, premature infants at the age of 1 month after term. METHODS: A triaxial accelerometer was used to measure upper-extremity limb acceleration in 3-dimensional space. Acceleration signals were recorded from the right wrist when the infant was in an active, alert state and lying in the supine position. The recording time was 200 seconds. The acceleration signal was sampled at a rate of 200 Hz. The acceleration time series data were analyzed by nonlinear analysis as well as linear analysis. RESULTS: The nonlinear time series analysis indicated that spontaneous movements of premature infants have nonlinear, chaotic, dynamic characteristics. The movements of the infants with brain injuries were characterized by larger dimensionality, and they were more unstable and unpredictable than those of infants without brain injuries. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: As determined by nonlinear analysis, the spontaneous movements of the premature infants with brain injuries had the characteristics of increased disorganization compared with those of the infants without brain injuries. Infants with brain injuries may manifest problems with self-organization as a function of the coordination of subsystems. Physical therapists should be able to support interactions among the subsystems and promote self-organization of motor learning through the individualized provision of various sensorimotor experiences for infants.},

For this purpose, extensive thermodynamic and kinetic research on silicon transfer inside the blast furnace has been carried out in the past decades.1-5) Based on these studies, a fundamental understanding about this phenomenon has been progressively established. However, up to now, a fully reliable mechanistic model for silicon prediction is not still to emerge because of the exceeding difficulty in quantifying ironmaking process chemistry. Thus, data-driven modeling is being investigated quite intensively recently in an attempt to solve this intractable problem. In the process of data-driven modeling, the frequently used tools include neural net,6-11) partial least squares,12,13) fuzzy mathematics,14) nonlinear time series analysis,15,16) chaos,17-19) etc. The main motivation is that, most of these tools have universal nonlinear approximation capabilities and can approach any function in any precision. As an alternative tool, Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) is applied in this paper to predict the silicon content in BF hot metal. The results indicate that the hit rate of silicon prediction is improved greatly when using the established predictive model and the prediction precision can reach 10{\^{}}-3 in the magnitude.},

abstract = {In this paper, two-phase-flow oscillations at the natural-circulation CIRCUS test facility are investigated in a two-riser configuration. These oscillations are driven by flashing (and to some extent by geysering). For a given range of operating conditions of the facility, the oscillations exhibit erratic behavior. This study demonstrates that this behavior can be attributed to deterministic chaos. This is proven by performing a continuous wavelet transform of the measured time series. Any hidden self-similarity in the measurement is seen in the corresponding scale-space plane. The novelty of the present investigation lies with the multifractal approach used for characterizing the chaos. Both nonlinear time series analysis and wavelet-based analysis methods show that the dynamics of the flow oscillations has a multifractal structure. For the former, both Higuchi's method and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) were used, whereas for the latter, the wavelet-transform modulus-maxima method was used. The strange attractor corresponding to the dynamics of the system can thus be described as a set of interwoven monofractal objects. The global singular properties of the measured time series is then fully characterized by a spectrum of singularities f(alpha), which is the Hausdorff dimension of the set of points where the multifractal object has singularities of strength (or Holder exponents of) alpha. Whereas Higuchis method and DFA allow easily determining whether the deterministic chaos has a monofractal or multifractal hierarchy, the wavelet-transform modulus-maxima has the advantage of giving a quantitative estimation of the fractal spectrum. The time-modeling of such behavior of the facility is therefore difficult since there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions. From a regulatory point of view, such behavior of natural-circulation systems in a multiple-riser configuration has thus to be avoided.},

abstract = {Although hyperspectral remotely sensed data are believed to be nonlinear, they are often modeled and processed by algorithms assuming that the data are realizations of some linear stochastic processes. This is likely due to the reason that either the nonlinearity of the data may not be strong enough, and the algorithms based on linear data assumption may still do the job, or the effective algorithms that are capable of dealing with nonlinear data are not widely available. The simplification on data characteristics, however, may compromise the effectiveness and accuracy of information extraction from hyperspectral imagery. In this paper, we are investigating the existence of non- linearity in hyperspectral data represented by a 4-m Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer image acquired over an area of coastal forests on Vancouver Island. The method employed for the investigation is based on the statistical test using surrogate data, an approach often used in nonlinear time series analysis. In addition to the high-order autocorrelation, spectral angle is utilized as the discriminating statistic to evaluate the differences between the hyperspectral data and their surrogates. To facilitate the statistical test, simulated data sets are created under linear stochastic constraints. Both simulated and real hyperspectral data are rearranged into a set of spectral series where the spectral and spatial adjacency of the original data is maintained as much as possible. This paper reveals that the differences are statistically significant between the values of discriminating statistics derived from the hyperspectral data and their surrogates. This indicates that the selected hyperspectral data are nonlinear in the spectral domain. Algorithms that are capable of explicitly addressing the nonlinearity are needed for processing hyperspectral remotely sensed data.},

abstract = {We report a comprehensive investigation of a model for peeling of an adhesive tape along with a nonlinear time series analysis of experimental acoustic emission signals in an effort to understand the origin of intermittent peeling of an adhesive tape and its connection to acoustic emission. The model represents the acoustic energy dissipated in terms of Rayleigh dissipation functional that depends on the local strain rate. We show that the nature of the peel front exhibits rich spatiotemporal patterns ranging from smooth, rugged, and stuck-peeled configurations that depend on three parameters, namely the ratio of inertial time scale of the tape mass to that of the roller, the dissipation coefficient, and the pull velocity. The stuck-peeled configurations are reminiscent of fibrillar peel front patterns observed in experiments. We show that while the intermittent peeling is controlled by the peel force function, the model acoustic energy dissipated depends on the nature of the peel front and its dynamical evolution. Even though the acoustic energy is a fully dynamical quantity, it can be quite noisy for a certain set of parameter values, suggesting the deterministic origin of acoustic emission in experiments. To verify this suggestion, we have carried out a dynamical analysis of experimental acoustic emission time series for a wide range of traction velocities. Our analysis shows an unambiguous presence of chaotic dynamics within a subinterval of pull speeds within the intermittent regime. Time-series analysis of the model acoustic energy signals is also found to be chaotic within a subinterval of pull speeds. Further, the model provides insight into several statistical and dynamical features of the experimental acoustic emission signals including the transition from burst-type acoustic emission to continuous-type with increasing pull velocity and the connection between acoustic emission and stick-slip dynamics. Finally, the model also offers an explanation for the recently observed feature that the duration of the slip phase can be less than that of the stick phase.},

abstract = {1. Why did you begin working with complex systems? Why I began working with complex systems is much clearer to me now than during the 1970s when I started to work on nonlinear dynamical systems. The way I think about my original motivations is best expressed as a historical reconstruction, giving some insight to the times and how the field developed. Hopefully, it casts the answer in a way that highlights the intellectual challenges. From this perspective, one can see the recent history of complex systems as two sides of the same coin. The first side was the discovery that simple systems can appear random (and high dimensional), even when consisting only of low-dimensional, but nonlinear coupled components (aka " deterministic chaos "). Despite our intuitively negative reaction to unpredictability, deterministic chaos was great news at the time. Could much of the randomness that we see around us in the natural world be, underneath, hidden away, simple nonlinear dynamical systems? If so, we might be able to extract the hidden simplicity—states and dynamic—from a few, or even one, variable. Answering this question led to the introduction of the idea of reconstructing " Geometry from a Times Series " by Norman Packard, myself, Doyne Farmer, and Rob Shaw in 1979. By the mid-1980s that idea had spawned much work on nonlinear time series analysis, which provided an important push against the then-dominant focus on linear, stationary, independent, identically distributed processes. However, success in analyzing how chaos arises set up a second, more problematic side of the coin—the attempt to answer a complementary puzzle. If simple systems can spontaneously generate random-appearing behavior, why do large-scale systems with many components appear ordered? In short, what is the origin of organization in a chaotic world? This question led me to explore the mechanisms of pattern formation in spatially extended dynamical systems by introducing the prototype class of map lattices and experimenting with video feedback, chemical oscillators, and ferrofluids. Quite a bit of groundwork on spatial systems had been laid decades before by statistical physicists studying phase transitions and critical phenomena. But their approach was not very " dynamical " and relied on assumptions of ergodicity to explore spatial organization through random samples of spatial configurations. To my mind,},

It is found that nonlinear characteristics of the wall temperature time series vary with spatial position in the evaporator at given operation conditions, and thus the multi-phase flow boiling behavior. However, the signals obtained at given axial position but different heated tubes in the evaporator exhibit more similar nonlinear evolution behavior, and those measured in the same heated tube but at different axial heights in the evaporator undergo more distinct nonlinear dynamic behavior. Multi-scale phenomena in different spatial positions are also found and discussed. These transient aspects of inner wall temperatures are closely related to the average holdup of solid particles and motion of vapor bubbles in vapor-liquid-solid flow.

abstract = {Legume plants form beneficial symbiotic interactions with nitrogen fixing bacteria (called rhizobia), with the rhizobia being accommodated in unique structures on the roots of the host plant. The legume/rhizobial symbiosis is responsible for a significant proportion of the global biologically available nitrogen. The initiation of this symbiosis is governed by a characteristic calcium oscillation within the plant root hair cells and this signal is activated by the rhizobia. Recent analyses on calcium time series data have suggested that stochastic effects have a large role to play in defining the nature of the oscillations. The use of multiple nonlinear time series techniques, however, suggests an alternative interpretation, namely deterministic chaos. We provide an extensive, nonlinear time series analysis on the nature of this calcium oscillation response. We build up evidence through a series of techniques that test for determinism, quantify linear and nonlinear components, and measure the local divergence of the system. Chaos is common in nature and it seems plausible that properties of chaotic dynamics might be exploited by biological systems to control processes within the cell. Systems possessing chaotic control mechanisms are more robust in the sense that the enhanced flexibility allows more rapid response to environmental changes with less energetic costs.

abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis was used to estimate maximal Lyapunov exponents of select ankle and knee kinematics during three different conditions of treadmill walking: independent, side by side, and side by side with forced synchronization of stepping. Stride to stride variability was significantly increased for the condition in which individuals walked side by side and synchronized unintentionally when compared to the conditions of forced synchronization and independent walking. In addition, standard deviations of three kinematic variables of lower extremity movement were significantly increased during the condition in which unintentional synchronization occurred. No relationship was found between standard deviation and estimates of maximal Lyapunov exponents. An increase in kinematic variability during side by side walking for nonimpaired individuals who are not at risk of falling suggests that variability in certain aspects of performance might be indicative of a healthy system. Modeling this variability for an impaired individual to imitate may have beneficial effects on locomotor function. These results may therefore have implications for the rehabilitation of gait in humans by suggesting that a different functional outcome might be achieved by practicing side by side walking as opposed to more commonly used strategies involving independent walking.},

abstract = {Ants have evolved very complex societies and are key ecosystem members. Some ants, such as the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, are also major pests. Here, we present a draft genome of S. invicta, assembled from Roche 454 and Illumina sequencing reads obtained from a focal haploid male and his brothers. We used comparative genomic methods to obtain insight into the unique features of the S. invicta genome. For example, we found that this genome harbors four adjacent copies of vitellogenin. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that an ancestral vitellogenin gene first underwent a duplication that was followed by possibly independent duplications of each of the daughter vitellogenins. The vitellogenin genes have undergone subfunctionalization with queen- and worker-specific expression, possibly reflecting differential selection acting on the queen and worker castes. Additionally, we identified more than 400 putative olfactory receptors of which at least 297 are intact. This represents the largest repertoire reported so far in insects. S. invicta also harbors an expansion of a specific family of lipid-processing genes, two putative orthologs to the transformer/feminizer sex differentiation gene, a functional DNA methylation system, and a single putative telomerase ortholog. EST data indicate that this S. invicta telomerase ortholog has at least four spliceforms that differ in their use of two sets of mutually exclusive exons. Some of these and other unique aspects of the fire ant genome are likely linked to the complex social behavior of this species.},

A complementary grid smoother is also made to enable computing of the likelihood. This helps us to formulate an expectation maximisation algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the state noise and the observation noise.

We capture its dynamics by analyzing a recording of the singing activity during mating time. First, we reconstruct the phase space from the sound recording and thereby reveal that the attractor needs no less than five degrees of freedom to fully evolve in the embedding space, which suggests that a rather complex nonlinear dynamics underlies its existence. Prior to investigating the dynamics more precisely, we test whether the reconstructed attractor satisfies the notions of determinism and stationarity, as a lack of either of these properties would preclude a meaningful further analysis. After positively establishing determinism and stationarity, we proceed by showing that the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the recording is positive, which is a strong indicator for the chaotic behavior of the system, confirming that dynamical nonlinearities are an integral part of the examined sound-producing apparatus. At the end, we discuss that methods of nonlinear time series analysis could yield instructive insights and foster the understanding of vocal communication among certain reptile species. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Several efforts have been made to study gait stability using measures derived from nonlinear time-series analysis. The maximum finite time Lyapunov exponent ($\lambda$max) quantifies how a system responds to an infinitesimally small perturbation. Recent studies suggested that slow walking leads to lower $\lambda$maxvalues, and thus is more stable than fast walking, but these studies suffer from methodological limitations. We studied the effects of walking speed on the amount of kinematic variability and stability in human walking. Trunk motions of 15 healthy volunteers were recorded in 3D during 2 min of treadmill walking at different speeds. From those time series, maximum Lyapunov exponents, indicating short-term and long-term divergence ($\lambda$S-strideand $\lambda$L-stride), and mean standard deviation (MeanSD) were calculated. $\lambda$S-strideshowed a linear decrease with increasing speed for forward-backward (AP) movements and quadratic effects (inverted U-shaped) for medio-lateral (ML) and up-down (VT) movements. $\lambda$L-strideshowed a quadratic effect (inverted U-shaped) of walking speed for AP movements, a linear decrease for ML movements, and a linear increase for VT movements. Moreover, positive correlations between $\lambda$Sand MeanSD were found for all directions, while $\lambda$L-strideand MeanSD were correlated negatively in the AP direction. The different effects of walking speed on $\lambda$S-strideand $\lambda$L-stridefor the different planes suggest that slow walking is not necessarily more stable than fast walking. The absence of a consistent pattern of correlations between $\lambda$L-strideand MeanSD over the three directions suggests that variability and stability reflect, at least to a degree, different properties of the dynamics of walking. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The method is based on (i) the decomposition of a high-dimensional molecular dynamics trajectory into a few "system" and (many) "bath" degrees of freedom and (ii) a Langevin simulation of the resulting model. Employing principal component analysis, the dimension of the system is chosen such that it contains all slow large-amplitude motions of the molecule, while the bath coordinates only account for its high-frequency fluctuations. It is shown that a sufficiently large dimension of the model is essential to ensure a clear time scale separation of system and bath variables, which warrants the validity of the memory-free Langevin equation. Applying methods from nonlinear time series analysis, a practical Langevin algorithm is presented which performs a local estimation of the multidimensional Langevin vector fields describing deterministic drift and stochastic driving. Adopting a 800 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the folding of heptaalanine in explicit water, it is shown that a five-dimensional Langevin model correctly reproduces the structure and conformational dynamics of the system. The virtues and limits of the approach are discussed in some detail.},

abstract = {A paradox regarding the classic power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is whether the characteristic high- (HF) and low-frequency (LF) spectral peaks represent stochastic or chaotic phenomena. Resolution of this fundamental issue is key to unraveling the mechanisms of HRV, which is critical to its proper use as a noninvasive marker for cardiac mortality risk assessment and stratification in congestive heart failure (CHF) and other cardiac dysfunctions. However, conventional techniques of nonlinear time series analysis generally lack sufficient sensitivity, specificity and robustness to discriminate chaos from random noise, much less quantify the chaos level. Here, we apply a 'litmus test' for heartbeat chaos based on a novel noise titration assay which affords a robust, specific, time-resolved and quantitative measure of the relative chaos level. Noise titration of running short-segment Holter tachograms from healthy subjects revealed circadian-dependent (or sleep/wake-dependent) heartbeat chaos that was linked to the HF component (respiratory sinus arrhythmia). The relative 'HF chaos' levels were similar in young and elderly subjects despite proportional age-related decreases in HF and LF power. In contrast, the near-regular heartbeat in CHF patients was primarily nonchaotic except punctuated by undetected ectopic beats and other abnormal beats, causing transient chaos. Such profound circadian-, age- and CHF-dependent changes in the chaotic and spectral characteristics of HRV were accompanied by little changes in approximate entropy, a measure of signal irregularity. The salient chaotic signatures of HRV in these subject groups reveal distinct autonomic, cardiac, respiratory and circadian/sleep-wake mechanisms that distinguish health and aging from CHF.},

It suggests a novel approach to defining the topological structure and initial weights of DRNN based on the spatial associations of spatial units. This is seen as vital for improving the accuracy and efficiency of prediction and forecasting using space-time models. The proposed method is illustrated using three instances of space-time analysis, which are each characterized by different spatial data types (discrete and continuous). Computational accuracy and efficiency are much improved by incorporating spatial associations in DRNN.

A RELAP5 model developed for a test facility and its prototype is used to record additional system parameters that were not included in the data obtained from experiments. The flow oscillations observed during experimental and numerical studies are analyzed and classified. It is inferred that the low amplitude oscillations are not condensation induced geysering instabilities, but a density wave instability supported by flashing. The similarity between the nature of startup transients observed in the test facility and the prototype is also examined. The effect of flashing is more pronounced in the prototype due to the strong variation of saturation temperature as the length scale is 4 times that of the model. The time series data obtained from experimental observations and numerical simulations are analyzed to identify the structural nature of flow oscillations. The power spectral density estimated using fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm illustrates the chaotic nature of the signals.

The possibility of using the first several natural frequencies of a circular plate for damage detection purposes was investigated first. The study then suggested a damage detection method, which considered a vibrating plate as a dynamic system and used its time-domain response represented in a new phase (state) space to extract damage sensitive characteristics. The paper introduced the idea of using large amplitude vibrations and nonlinear time series analysis for damage detection purposes. The suggested damage detection approach explored the possibility to use certain characteristics of the distribution of phase space points on the attractor of the system. It studied the histograms of this distribution and attempts to extract damage sensitive features. Three damage features were suggested and they are shown to detect damage at a rather low level using a finite element model of the plate. The method suggested was rather generic and permits development and application to more complex structures and real data.},

The phase space is reconstructed from series derived from regularly repeated GPS measurements that were transformed into a unified terrestrial frame. For the reconstruction the time-delay method was used, a concept in nonlinear time series analysis as developed by Packard (Packard et al. 1980) and proved by Takens (Takens 1981). The underlying dynamical model is a Hamiltonian motion equation so the reconstructed space is extended according to holonomic conjugated Hamiltonian coordinates. The GPS measurements are selected from a small area of geodynamical interest after its investigation based on analysis of raw geoidal signals (Doufexopoulou et al. 2006). Points from a neutral zone are used also for comparison purposes.The investigation aims to show that there exist significant differences in essential features of the chaotic behavior of the dynamical systems derived from the points of geodynamical interest and those from the neutral zone (in level of determinism and stability, in attractors, etc.). The method can be used to detect and investigate areas with geodynamical interest where already exist time dependent GPS measurements and at a large, continental scale.$\backslash$n},

In this study non-linear time series analysis methods have been performed in order to analyze the dynamics of the blade. The dynamics have been captured by analyzing a record of the signal provided by strain gauges fixed on the blade.

abstract = {Several efforts have been made to study gait stability using measures derived from nonlinear time- series analysis. The maximum finite time Lyapunov exponent (lmax) quantifies how a system responds to an infinitesimally small perturbation. Recent studies suggested that slowwalking leads to lower lmax values, and thus is more stable than fast walking, but these studies suffer from methodological limitations.We studied the effects ofwalking speed on the amount of kinematic variability and stability in human walking. Trunk motions of 15 healthy volunteers were recorded in 3D during 2min of treadmill walking at different speeds. From those time series, maximum Lyapunov exponents, indicating short-term and long-term divergence (lS-stride and lL-stride), and mean standard deviation (MeanSD) were calculated. lS-stride showed a linear decrease with increasing speed for forward–back- ward (AP) movements and quadratic effects (inverted U-shaped) for medio-lateral (ML) and up–down (VT) movements. lL-stride showed a quadratic effect (inverted U-shaped) of walking speed for AP movements, a linear decrease for ML movements, and a linear increase for VT movements. Moreover, positive correlations between lS and MeanSD were found for all directions, while lL-stride and MeanSD were correlated negatively in the AP direction. The different effects of walking speed on lS-stride and lL-stride for the different planes suggest that slow walking is not necessarily more stable than fast walking. The absence of a consistent pattern of correlations between lL-stride and MeanSD over the three directions suggests that variability and stability reflect, at least to a degree, different properties of the dynamics of walking.},

abstract = {A paradox regarding the classic power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is whether the characteristic high-(HF) and low-frequency (LF) spectral peaks represent stochastic or chaotic phenomena. Resolution of this fundamental issue is key to unraveling the mechanisms of HRV, which is critical to its proper use as a noninvasive marker for cardiac mortality risk assessment and stratification in congestive heart failure (CHF) and other cardiac dysfunctions. However, conventional techniques of nonlinear time series analysis generally lack sufficient sensitivity, specificity and robustness to discriminate chaos from random noise, much less quantify the chaos level. Here, we apply a 'litmus test' for heartbeat chaos based on a novel noise titration assay which affords a robust, specific, time-resolved and quantitative measure of the relative chaos level. Noise titration of running short-segment Holter tachograms from healthy subjects revealed circadian-dependent (or sleep/wake-dependent) heartbeat chaos that was linked to the HF component (respiratory sinus arrhythmia). The relative 'HF chaos' levels were similar in young and elderly subjects despite proportional age-related decreases in HF and LF power. In contrast, the near-regular heartbeat in CHF patients was primarily nonchaotic except punctuated by undetected ectopic beats and other abnormal beats, causing transient chaos. Such profound circadian-, age- and CHF-dependent changes in the chaotic and spectral characteristics of HRV were accompanied by little changes in approximate entropy, a measure of signal irregularity. The salient chaotic signatures of HRV in these subject groups reveal distinct autonomic, cardiac, respiratory and circadian/sleep-wake mechanisms that distinguish health and aging from CHF. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wu et al.},

abstract = {Astronomy research is concerned with the precise description and understanding of Earth orientation parameters (polar motion and length of day), time series that are obtained from several terrestrial and space observational techniques. The Earth rotation time series has been extensively studied from a linear point of view, considering that the underlying dynamics were composed of well-defined oscillations above a level of noises. If this can apply to the main part of the signal, where periodic oscillations are observed, it becomes problematic when dealing with short-term fluctuations. Indeed, linear method would conclude that this part of the signal is only composed of noises. Nevertheless, as the main forcing processes of the short-term fluctuations of the Earth comes from atmospheric processes through angular momentum exchanges, and because it was demonstrated that their dynamics were mainly nonlinear, it appears necessary to investigate the research of nonlinear dynamical processes in Earth rotation data. This is a challenge that we have initiated and that needs to be integrated in future research. We present in the chapter a review of several studies we have carried out on this topic and some perspectives of research. As an introductory part, we describe the main components of the Earth rotation signal and their astronomical or geophysical origin. In a second part, we explain the principles of nonlinear time series analysis and their theoretical links to the dynamical system theory. We demonstrate how these tools give the possibility to break with the traditional spectra analysis that fails to capture nonlinear processes. To illustrate those points, we present results from several studies (on the Earth's rotation itself and on the related atmospheric flows) where we have described chaotic components in a topological and a dynamical way. We explain why our results have important implications for future research in astronomy. Indeed, they show that deterministic processes can be found and have to be searched in the "noisy" part of the system. Additionally, the prediction of the Earth orientation parameters is still performed with linear methods. We encourage applying in the future nonlinear predicting tools for the Earth's rotation. Moreover, the oceanic processes are also acting on the Earth and an analysis of oceanic time series can precisely measure how all of those dynamics interact together. {\textcopyright} 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Starting from the concept of recurrences in phase space, the recurrence matrix of a time series is interpreted as the adjacency matrix of an associated complex network, which links different points in time if the considered states are closely neighboured in phase space. In comparison with similar network-based techniques the new approach has important conceptual advantages, and can be considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex networks that also includes other existing methods as special cases. It has been demonstrated here that there are fundamental relationships between many topological properties of recurrence networks and different nontrivial statistical properties of the phase space density of the underlying dynamical system. Hence, this novel interpretation of the recurrence matrix yields new quantitative characteristics (such as average path length, clustering coefficient, or centrality measures of the recurrence network) related to the dynamical complexity of a time series, most of which are not yet provided by other existing methods of nonlinear time series analysis.},

abstract = {In electricity markets where supply and demand drives the price for the purchase and sale of electricity, generating firms change capacity for various reasons including load level, policy, and varying market conditions. These types of fluctuating production patterns can result in the reduction of market efficiency. In an inefficient market, where the price for electricity exceeds marginal cost, the locational marginal price (LMP) is often used to measure market efficiency. Stochastically driven changes in the market are captured by this approach, however, these random changes (frequently observed in efficient markets as well) do not affect market efficiency in the long run. Conversely, a slow, consistent change is not captured by the snap-shot approach and affects the efficiency significantly. Therefore, it is necessary to construct an algorithm that captures only consistent changes that truly affect market efficiency. Fractal analysis can characterize a price behavior in the electricity markets because the price exhibits a self-similarity.11A self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself. Once a system undergoes a change, the fractal dimension of the system reflects the change.

abstract = {PURPOSE: In recent years, a variety of methods developed in the field of linear and nonlinear time series analysis have been used to obtain reliable predictions of epileptic seizures. Because individual methods for seizure prediction so far have shown statistical significance but insufficient performance for clinical applications, we investigated possible improvements by combining algorithms capturing different aspects of electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics. METHODS: We applied the mean phase coherence and the dynamic similarity index to long-term continuous intracranial EEG data. The predictive performance of both methods was assessed and statistically evaluated separately, as well as by using logical "AND" and "OR" combinations. RESULTS: Used independently, either method resulted in a statistically significant prediction performance in only a few patients. Particularly the "AND" combination led to improved prediction performances, leading to an increase in sensitivity and/or specificity. For a maximum false prediction rate of 0.15/h, the mean sensitivity improved from about 25{\%} for the individual methods to 43.2{\%} for the "AND" and to 35.2{\%} for the "OR" combination. DISCUSSION: This study shows that combinations of prediction methods are promising new approaches to enhance seizure prediction performance considerably. It allows merging the individual benefits of prediction methods in a complementary manner. Because either sensitivity or specificity of seizure prediction methods can be improved depending on the needs of the desired clinical application, the combination opens a new window for future use in a clinical setting.},

In the last years, some methods mapping time series to network representations have been proposed. The purpose is to investigate on the properties of the series through graph theoretical tools recently developed in the core of the celebrated complex network theory. Among some other methods, the so-called visibility algorithm has received much attention, since it has been shown that series correlations are captured by the algorithm and translated in the associated graph, opening the possibility of building fruitful connections between time series analysis, nonlinear dynamics, and graph theory. Here we use the horizontal visibility algorithm to characterize and distinguish between correlated stochastic, uncorrelated and chaotic processes. We show that in every case the series maps into a graph with exponential degree distribution P (k) {\~{}} exp(-{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}k), where the value of {\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}} characterizes the specific process. The frontier between chaotic and correlated stochastic processes, {\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}} = ln(3/2), can be calculated exactly, and some other analytical developments confirm the results provided by extensive numerical simulations and (short) experimental time series.},

At first, the false neighbors ?FNs? in a neighborhood for each pixel are removed according to the context. After moving the FNs, we obtain an SN, where the NTS is stationary and the real state can be estimated using the theory of stationary time series ?STS?. Since each SN of an image pixel consists of elements with similar context and nearby locations, the method proposed in this paper can not only adaptively find neighbors and determine size of the SN according to the characteristics of a pixel, but also be able to denoise while effectively preserving edges. Finally, in order to show the superiority of this algorithm, we compare this method with the existing universal denoising algorithms.},

abstract = {A nonlinear time series analysis is presented to detect damage in systems under varying operational and environmental conditions. This paper summarizes the use of a state-space reconstruction to infer the geometrical structure of a deterministic dynamical system from observed time series of the system response at multiple locations. The unique contribution of this paper is using a Multivariate Autoregressive (MAR) model of a baseline health condition to predict the state space, where the model encodes the embedding vectors rather than scalar time series. A hypothesis test is established that the MAR model will fail to predict future response if damage is present in the test condition, and this test is investigated for robustness in the context of operational and environmental variability (nondamage-related events). The applicability of this approach is demonstrated using multi-channel acceleration time series from a base-excited three-story building structure tested in laboratory environment. Under the assumption that many "real-word" damage modes induce transitions from linear to nonlinear response in a system, damage is simulated by a bumper mechanism that creates a repetitive, impact-type nonlinearity. Operational and environmental variations are simulated by changing stiffness and mass conditions, based on the assumption that these sources of variability usually manifest themselves as linear effects on measured data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We propose an experimental setup allowing for the characterization of laser droplet generation in terms of the underlying dynamics, primarily showing that the latter is deterministically chaotic by means of nonlinear time series analysis methods. In particular, we use a laser pulse to melt the end of a properly fed vertically placed metal wire. Due to the interplay of surface tension, gravity force, and light-metal interaction, undulating pendant droplets are formed at the molten end, which eventually completely detach from the wire as a consequence of their increasing mass. We capture the dynamics of this process by employing a high-speed infrared camera, thereby indirectly measuring the temperature of the wire end and the pendant droplets. The time series is subsequently generated as the mean value over the pixel intensity of every infrared snapshot. Finally, we employ methods of nonlinear time series analysis to reconstruct the phase space from the observed variable and test it against determinism and stationarity. After establishing that the observed laser droplet generation is a deterministic and dynamically stationary process, we calculate the spectra of Lyapunov exponents. We obtain a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a negative divergence, i.e., sum of all the exponents, thus indicating that the observed dynamics is deterministically chaotic with an attractor as solution in the phase space. In addition to characterizing the dynamics of laser droplet generation, we outline industrial applications of the process and point out the significance of our findings for future attempts at mathematical modeling.},

Moreover, we estimate the time delay patterns of rain events. Here we present an analysis of two separate high resolution gridded data sets of daily rainfall covering the Indian subcontinent. Using the method of event synchronization (ES), we estimate regions where heavy rain events during monsoon happen in some lag synchronised form. Further using the delay behaviour of rainfall events, we estimate the directionalities related to the progress of such type of rainfall events. The Active (break) phase of a monsoon is characterised by an increase(decrease) of rainfall over certain regions of the Indian subcontinent.

Recurrence, determinism, entropy, distance of activity patterns, and correlation in correspondence to spike and burst parameters (e.g., mean spiking rate, mean bursting rate, burst duration, spike in burst, etc.) have been computed to characterize and assess the daily changes of the neuronal electrophysiology during neuronal network development and maturation. The results show the similarities/differences between several channels and time periods as well as the evolution of the spontaneous activity in the MEA chip. RPs could be used for graphically exploring possible neuronal dynamic breaking/changing points, whereas RQA parameters are suited for locating them. The combination of RQA with traditional approaches improves the identification, description, and prediction of electrophysiological changes and it will be used to allow intercomparison between results obtained from different MEA chips.

abstract = {Many complex and interesting phenomena in nature are due to nonlinear phenomena. The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called 'chaos theory', has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages. Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results in terms of 'functional sources' and 'functional networks' allows the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i) normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated with normal information processing, whereas both hyper-as well as hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing and disturbed consciousness},

In this paper, an experiment is designed in which acupuncture is made at Zusanli with four different acupuncture manipulations to obtain action potentials on dorsal spinal nerve root. The concept of the interspike interval (ISI) is used for the study of the acupuncture electrical signals. Several nonlinear characteristic parameters are extracted, such as the Lyapunov exponent, correlation dimension and Lempel-Ziv complexity, and the neural coding of the electrical signal evoked by different acupuncture manipulations is obtained. It is also shown that under the effect of the acupuncture, the electrical signals of dorsal spinal nerve root based on acupuncture at Zusanli point has distinguished chaotic features.},

abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study of the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of taut steel cables using a 3-D motion analysis system. In the experiment, the taut cables have one end fixed and the other end subject to harmonic vertical excitation. The 3-D motion analysis system can simultaneously record (with high resolution) the instant 3-D coordinates of the multiple markers fixed on a vibrating cable: this distinguishes it from other experimental systems used in vibration studies, in which the vibration of only one single point can be recorded during each individual testing. With the 3-D motion analysis system, this experimental study presents a distinctive interpretation of the dynamic characteristics of taut cables in spatial domain (based on the mode-shape information of the entire cable), in addition to one in time domain (based on real-time traces of one single point). This paper introduces the 3-D motion analysis system and experimental setup, discusses practical experimental procedures, and presents a detailed analysis of three sets of experimental vibration data of three taut steel cables with different small sags. The frequency response curves were obtained for three cables. For one of the three taut cables, more informative vibration data were recorded; this cable was studied in greater detail via modal analysis using a modal decomposition technique and nonlinear time-series analysis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Accurate and fine-grained prediction of future user location and geographical profile has interesting and promising applications including targeted content service, advertisement dissemination for mobile users, and recreational social networking tools for smart-phones. Existing techniques based on linear and probabilistic models are not able to provide accurate prediction of the location patterns from a spatio-temporal perspective, especially for long-term estimation. More specifically, they are able to only forecast the next location of a user, but not his/her arrival time and residence time , i.e., the interval of time spent in that location. Moreover, these techniques are often based on prediction models that are not able to extend predictions further in the future. In this paper we present NextPlace, a novel approach to location prediction based on nonlinear time series analysis of the arrival and residence times of users in relevant places. NextPlace focuses on the predictability of single users when they visit their most important places, rather than on the transitions between different locations. We report about our evaluation using four different datasets and we compare our forecasting results to those obtained by means of the prediction techniques proposed in the literature. We show how we achieve higher performance compared to other predictors and also more stability over time, with an overall prediction precision of up to 90{\%} and a performance increment of at least 50{\%} with respect to the state of the art.},

abstract = {GRS 1915+105 is a prominent black hole system exhibiting variability over a wide range of time scales and its observed light curves have been classified into 12 temporal states. Here we undertake a complete analysis of these light curves from all the states using various quantifiers from nonlinear time series analysis, such as, the correlation dimension (D{\_}2), the correlation entropy (K{\_}2), singular value decomposition (SVD) and the multifractal spectrum ({\$}f(\backslashalpha){\$} spectrum). An important aspect of our analysis is that, for estimating these quantifiers, we use algorithmic schemes which we have proposed recently and tested successfully on synthetic as well as practical time series from various fields. Though the schemes are based on the conventional delay embedding technique, they are automated so that the above quantitative measures can be computed using conditions prescribed by the algorithm and without any intermediate subjective analysis. We show that nearly half of the 12 temporal states exhibit deviation from randomness and their complex temporal behavior could be approximated by a few (3 or 4) coupled ordinary nonlinear differential equations. These results could be important for a better understanding of the processes that generate the light curves and hence for modelling the temporal behavior of such complex systems. To our knowledge, this is the first complete analysis of an astrophysical object (let alone a black hole system) using various techniques from nonlinear dynamics.},

abstract = {Testing for nonlinearity is one of the most important preprocessing steps in nonlinear time series analysis. Typically, this is done by means of the linear surrogate data methods. But it is a known fact that the validity of the results heavily depends on the stationarity of the time series. Since most physiological signals are non-stationary, it is easy to falsely detect nonlinearity using the linear surrogate data methods. In this document, we propose a methodology to extend the procedure for generating constrained surrogate time series in order to assess nonlinearity in non-stationary data. The method is based on the band-phase-randomized surrogates, which consists (contrary to the linear surrogate data methods) in randomizing only a portion of the Fourier phases in the high frequency domain. Analysis of simulated time series showed that in comparison to the linear surrogate data method, our method is able to discriminate between linear stationarity, linear non-stationary and nonlinear time series. Applying our methodology to heart rate variability (HRV) records of five healthy patients, we encountered that nonlinear correlations are present in this non-stationary physiological signals.},

Participants were 8 healthy full-term newborn infants (3 boys, 5 girls, mean birth weight and gestational age were 3070.6g and 39 weeks). A tri-axial accelerometer measured limb movement acceleration in 3-dimensional space. Movement acceleration signals were recorded during 200 s from just below the ankle when the infant was in an active alert state and lying supine (sampling rate 200 Hz). Data were analyzed linearly and nonlinearly. As a result, the optimal embedding dimension showed more than 5 at all times. Time dependent changes started at 6 or 7, and over the next four months decreased to 5 and from 6 months old, increased. The maximal Lyapnov exponent was positive for all segments. The mutual information is at its greatest range at 0 months. Between 3 and 4 months the range in results is narrowest and lowest in value. The mean coefficient of correlation for the x-axis component was negative and y-axis component changed to a positive value between 1 month old and 4 months old. Nonlinear time series analysis suggested that newborn and young infants' spontaneous lower extremity movements are characterized by a nonlinear chaotic dynamics with 5 to 7 embedding dimensions. Developmental changes of an optimal embedding dimension showed a U-shaped phenomenon. In addition, the maximal Lyapnov exponents were positive for all segments (0.79-2.99). Infants' spontaneous movement involves chaotic dynamic systems that are capable of generating voluntary skill movements.

abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis aims at understanding the dynamics of stochastic or chaotic processes. In recent years, quite a few methods have been proposed to transform a single time series to a complex network so that the dynamics of the process can be understood by investigating the topological properties of the network. We study the topological properties of horizontal visibility graphs constructed from fractional Brownian motions with different Hurst indexes H ∈ (0,1). Special attention has been paid to the impact of the Hurst index on topological properties. It is found that the clustering coefficient C decreases when H increases. We also found that the mean length L of the shortest paths increases exponentially with H for fixed length N of the original time series. In addition, L increases linearly with respect to N when H is close to 1 and in a logarithmic form when H is close to 0. Although the occurrence of different motifs changes with H, the motif rank pattern remains unchanged for different H. Adopting the node-covering box-counting method, the horizontal visibility graphs are found to be fractals and the fractal dimension dBdecreases with H. Furthermore, the Pearson coefficients of the networks are positive and the degree-degree correlations increase with degree, which indicate that the horizontal visibility graphs are assortative. With the increase of H, the Pearson coefficient decreases first and then increases, in which the turning point is around H = 0.6. The presence of both fractality and assortativity in the horizontal visibility graphs converted from fractional Brownian motions is different from many cases where fractal networks are usually disassortative. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

As it was initially developed for the study of dynamical systems, and was later used in nonlinear time series analysis, the question of using it as a signal processing tool has not been put into discussion yet. In this field the projective techniques are largely used, with good results. Nevertheless, they also have some limitations - especially regarding transient signal processing. But this kind of signals are ubiquitous in real world. In addition, propagation through various media as well as on multiple paths lead to delayed, attenuated and dilated versions of the original transients. In this paper we study the behaviour of the recurrence plot analysis method in the context of analyzing some finite duration signals being subject to rescalings of the amplitude and time axes.

Many studies have demonstrated that the complexity of EEG can reflect the states of the brain function, so we adopt two nonlinear time series analysis methods, i.e. Correlation Dimension and Order Patterns Recurrence Determinism, to investigate the effect of MA on the complexity of brain activities. It is found that the complexity of EEG during acupuncture is obviously higher than that before acupuncture, which can prove that MA has effect on the brain. {\&}copy; 2011 IEEE.},

We aimed to perform a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the dynamical properties of Earth tilt time series in the context of the development of a real-time telemetric monitoring system at the Enguri test area. The set of Earth tilt hourly time-series data, recorded during the construction of the Enguri power station and subsequent fill of reservoir (1971-1983), has been analyzed. Modern methods of linear and nonlinear time-series analysis have been used. It has been observed that Earth tilt sequences clearly reveal properties of low-dimensional dynamics. Quantitative changes in the dynamics of tilt generation connected with different stages of anthropogenic influence, such as the construction of the Enguri high dam and reservoir fill, have also been detected. It was shown that these changes are transient, since the character of Earth tilt dynamics has been restored at the end of observation.},

abstract = {The high-mass X-ray binary SMC X-1 exhibits a superorbital modulation with a dramatically varying period ranging between ∼40 days and ∼60 days. This research studies the time-frequency properties of the superorbital modulation of SMC X-1 based on the observations made by the All-Sky Monitor (ASM) onboard the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). We analyzed the entire ASM database collected since 1996. The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), developed for non-stationary and nonlinear time-series analysis, was adopted to derive the instantaneous superorbital frequency. The resultant Hilbert spectrum is consistent with the dynamic power spectrum as it shows more detailed information in both the time and frequency domains. The RXTE observations show that the superorbital modulation period was mostly between ∼50days and ∼65days, whereas it changed to 45 days around MJD 50,800 and MJD 54,000. Our analysis further indicates that the instantaneous frequency changed to a timescale of hundreds of days between ∼MJD 51,500 and ∼MJD 53,500. Based on the instantaneous phase defined by HHT, we folded the ASM light curve to derive a superorbital profile, from which an asymmetric feature and a low state with barely any X-ray emissions (lasting for ∼0.3 cycles) were observed. We also calculated the correlation between the mean period and the amplitude of the superorbital modulation. The result is similar to the recently discovered relationship between the superorbital cycle length and the mean X-ray flux for Her X-1. {\textcopyright} 2011. The American Astronomical Society.

We compare the result of the aforementioned methodology with the scaling behavior of the largest Lyapunov exponent computed by means of tangent space dynamics, which has, so far, been the most reliable method available to detect the strong stochasticity threshold. We find that indeed the 0-1 test can perform the detection in the range of energy density values studied. Furthermore, we determined that conventional nonlinear time series analysis methods fail to properly compute the largest Lyapounov exponent even for very large data sets, whereas the computational effort of the 0-1 test remains the same in the whole range of values of the energy density considered with moderate size time series. Therefore, our results show that, for a qualitative probing of phase space, the 0-1 test can be an effective tool if its limitations are properly taken into account.},

abstract = {Multi-channel recording is now a widely used tool in neuroscience research that makes it possible to study the activity of neuron population. The data collected from multiple neurons indicate important information of neural coding rules and brain function-al mechanism, which requires advanced computational techniques to decode. Here we reviewed the methods for multi-channel neural data analysis and gave brief introduction of their typical application for studying different kinds of neural data. One of the common ways to get information about neu-rophysiological system is to use computational analysis to study the features of the neural signals. For process-ing single neuron data, univariate analysis is used to draw neural response properties, such as the peri-stim-ulus time histogram (PSTH) [1] , spike triggered average (STA) [2] , spike triggered covariance (STC) [3] , computa-tion of entropy and patterns carried by spike trains [4, 5] and nonlinear time series analysis [6] . However, the neu-ral system processes and integrates information in large and highly complex neural network with rich interde-pendence and communication among neurons and functional regions, which contain meaningful interac-tions that univariate analysis fails to explain. In order to get deeper insight to the functioning of neural sys-tem, it is necessary to make use of the multivariate analysis to study the relationship of the neural signals which are simultaneously recorded in multiple neurons or functional regions under certain functional tasks or situations. Accordingly, multi-channel neural data anal-ysis methods are developed in wide ranges, with ad-vances in mathematical, statistical and information the-ories, to meet the needs of studying different kinds of neurophysiological data. Here we discuss the relationship of neural signals from two aspects, the synchronized firing or oscillation activities among neurons or brain regions, and the di-rection of neural information flow in neural network.},

abstract = {Understanding the intricacies of the dynamics of hydrological processes and describing them in a sophisticated way have gained increasing attention. A number of studies and approaches in the last decades have witnessed the possibility of short-term prediction and transformation of hydrological data from one scale to another. However, an important limitation of such approaches is that they treat the rainfall process as a realization of a stochastic process, and there seems to be a lack of connection between the structure of the models and the underlying physics of the rainfall process. In contrast, the recent interest in nonlinear dynamics and a rapidly growing set of tools for nonlinear time series analysis have provided brand new ideas into the working of many such complex processes. The present study makes an effort based on the notion of deterministic chaos to investigate tne behaviour of the dynamics of rainfall. Daily rainfall data observed at Zhangping weather station, in Fujian province, China, is studied. Results from the correlation dimension method and nonlinear prediction method, jointly indicate that the daily rainfall process exhibits nonlinear dynamics. However, different to results from the past studies, the minimum number of variables essential is identified as 5 and the number of sufficient variables is up to 16. This strong evidence proves that rainfall analysis only based on chaotic method is inadequate without combining stochastic or statistical methods. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 IAHS Press.},

They exhibit competitive advantages in comparison with the conventional linear methods but most of them heavily rely on the phase space reconstruction. In this paper the arrhythmias electrocardiograph (ECG) signals is investigated from the perspective of networks so as to find another effective approach independent of the phase space reconstruction to deeply discover some unknown information underlying the signals. The ECG signal is thereby transformed to a network topology, where its R-R cycles are regarded as nodes in the network, and link weights between two nodes are determined by Euclidean distance of corresponding two cycles. We then employ the network statistical criteria to discover the distinction among different cardiac rhythms. We validate this idea with atrial fibrillation (AF) and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) ECG signals. The results demonstrate that the differences between them can be well revealed from this novel perspective.

Based on the nonlinear time series analysis method, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of arm swing in three conditions (natural, active and restricted arm swing) on the dynamic stability of spine and lower extremity joints, and to further assess the contribution of arm swing to the human dynamic stability in relation with age. Gait experiments were carried out for 10 young and 8 middle-aged healthy volunteers while walking with natural, active and restricted arm swing. The maximum finite time lyapunov exponents were calculated to quantify the local dynamic stability of spine and lower extremity joints under three arm swing conditions, and the percentage change of the maximum Lyapunov exponents was compared between two groups to evaluate the effectiveness of active arm swing in relation with age. For both young and middle-aged groups, no significant difference of the maximum lyapunov exponents of all motion segments was found between walking with natural arm swing and with restricted arm swing (P{\textgreater}0.05). However, the maximum lyapunov exponents of all motion segments while walking with active arm swing was significantly lower than those while walking with natural arm swing and restricted arm swing, respectively (P{\textless}0.05), and the percentage decrease of the maximum lyapunov exponents for all motion segments while walking with active arm swing was significantly higher in middle-aged group than in young group (P{\textless}0.05).

abstract = {Several methods derived from nonlinear time series analysis have been suggested to quantify stability in human gait kinematics. One of these methods is the definition of the maximum finite time Lyapunov exponent ($\lambda$) that quantifies how the system responds to infinitesimal perturbations. However, there are fundamental limitations to the conventional definition of $\lambda$ for gait kinematics. First, exponential increase in initial perturbations cannot be assumed since real-life perturbations of gait kinematics are finite sized. Second, the transitions between single and double support phase within each stride cycle define two distinct dynamical regimes that may not be captured by a single $\lambda$. The present article presents a new method to quantify intra-stride changes $\lambda$(t) in local dynamical stability and employs the method to 3D lower extremity gait kinematics in 10 healthy adults walking on a treadmill at 3 different speeds. All participants showed an intra-stride change in $\lambda$(t) in the transition between single and double support phase. The intra-stride change reflected an both a increase and decrease in $\lambda$(t) at heel strike and toe off, respectively, with increased gait speed. Furthermore, a close relationship was found between the intra-stride change in standard deviation of foot velocity in the anterior-posterior direction and the intra-stride change of the initial perturbations. The present results indicate that local dynamical stability has gait phase-dependent changes that are not identified by conventional computation of a single $\lambda$. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recurrence networks are a novel tool of nonlinear time series analysis allowing the characterisation of higher-order geometric properties of complex dynamical systems based on recurrences in phase space, which are a fundamental concept in classical mechanics. In this Letter, we demonstrate that recurrence networks obtained from various deterministic model systems as well as experimental data naturally display power-law degree distributions with scaling exponents {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} that can be derived exclusively from the systems' invariant densities. For one-dimensional maps, we show analytically that {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} is not related to the fractal dimension. For continuous systems, we find two distinct types of behaviour: power-laws with an exponent {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} depending on a suitable notion of local dimension, and such with fixed {\$}\backslashgamma=1{\$}.},

This study introduces a new approach for the detection of nonlinear Granger causality in MV time series, based on embedding the series by a sequential, non-uniform procedure, and on estimating the information flow from one series to another by means of the corrected conditional entropy. The approach is validated on short realizations of linear stochastic and nonlinear deterministic processes, and then evaluated on heart period, systolic arterial pressure and respiration variability series measured from healthy humans in the resting supine position and in the upright position after head-up tilt. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We examined evidence for nonlinear dynamics in fishery-independent survey data for an assemblage of 26 fish species on Georges Bank spanning the period 1963 to 2008. We used nonlinear time series analysis to determine (1) the presence of nonlinear dynamics in fish populations on Georges Bank, (2) the minimum number of dimensions required to effectively describe system dynamics, (3) the strength of patterns of co-predictability among all possible pairs of fish species, and (4) identification of groups of species characterized by similar dynamics. Here, nonlinear behavior refers to non-equilibrium dynamics, including chaos. The population trajectories of all 26 species exhibited strong density-dependent feedback as indicated by a Partial Rate Correlation Function analysis. Significant evidence of complex dynamical behavior was found for approximately 1 in 5 species. Low dimensionality for many of the individual series was identified, suggesting that for a given level of predictability, this system can be represented by a relatively small number of critically important ecological variables. Further, we found high levels of copredictability among pairwise combinations of individual species. We identified 4 major species groups sharing similar dynamic features on the basis of patterns of co-predictability, and explored potential mechanisms for interpreting the groupings in terms of trophic interactions and life history characteristics.},

abstract = {This study examined profiles of change in repeated mother-child interactions over the course of a 12 week treatment period for childhood aggression. The aim of this study was to investigate whether it was possible to detect the characteristic profile of change, typical for phase transitions, over the course of treatment, and whether this profile was associated with positive treatment outcomes. Entropy values were computed for six repeated real-time observations of each mother-child dyad, using a novel application of recurrence quantification analysis for categorical time series. Subsequent latent class growth curve analysis on the sequences of entropy values revealed two distinct classes of dyads, with one class showing a clear peak in entropy over the six measurement points. The latent class membership variables showed a significant systematic relationship with observed dyad improvement (as rated by clinicians). The class with the peak in entropy over the sessions consisted largely of treatment improvers. Further analysis revealed that improvers and non-improvers could not be distinguished based on content-specific changes (e.g. more positivity or less negativity during the interaction). The present study revealed a treatment-related destabilization pattern in real-time behaviors that was related to better treatment outcomes, and underlines the value of dynamic nonlinear time-series analysis (especially RQA) in the study of dyadic interactions in clinical contexts.},

We automatically compute descriptors representing the melody and bass line using a state-of-the-art melody extraction algorithm, and compare them to a harmony-based descriptor. The similarity of descriptor sequences is computed using a dynamic programming algorithm based on nonlinear time series analysis which has been successfully used for version identification with harmony descriptors. After evaluating the accuracy of individual descriptors, we assess whether performance can be improved by descriptor fusion, for which we apply a classification approach, comparing different classification algorithms. We show that both melody and bass line descriptors carry useful information for version identification, and that combining them increases version detection accuracy. Whilst harmony remains the most reliable musical representation for version identification, we demonstrate how in some cases performance can be improved by combining it with melody and bass line descriptions. Finally, we identify some of the limitations of the proposed descriptor fusion approach, and discuss directions for future research.},

abstract = {In medical image segmentation, tumors and other lesions demand the highest levels of accuracy but still call for the highest levels of manual delineation. One factor holding back automatic segmentation is the exemption of pathological regions from shape modelling techniques that rely on high-level shape information not offered by lesions. This paper introduces two new statistical shape models (SSMs) that combine radial shape parameterization with machine learning techniques from the field of nonlinear time series analysis. We then develop two dynamic contour models (DCMs) using the new SSMs as shape priors for tumor and lesion segmentation. From training data, the SSMs learn the lower level shape information of boundary fluctuations, which we prove to be nevertheless highly discriminant. One of the new DCMs also uses online learning to refine the shape prior for the lesion of interest based on user interactions. Classification experiments reveal superior sensitivity and specificity of the new shape priors over those previously used to constrain DCMs. User trials with the new interactive algorithms show that the shape priors are directly responsible for improvements in accuracy and reductions in user demand.},

abstract = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which record the electrical activity in the brain, are useful for assessing the mental state of a person. Since these signals are nonlinear and non-stationary in nature, it is very difficult to decipher the useful information from them using conventional statistical and frequency domain methods. Hence, the application of nonlinear time series analysis to EEG signals could be useful to study the dynamical nature and variability of the brain signals. In this paper, we propose a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique for the automated identification of normal and alcoholic EEG signals using nonlinear features. We first extract nonlinear features such as Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE), Sample Entropy (SampEn), and four other Higher Order Spectra (HOS) features, and then use them to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier of varying kernel functions: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order polynomials and a Radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Our results indicate that these nonlinear measures are good discriminators of normal and alcoholic EEG signals. The SVM classifier with a polynomial kernel of order 1 could distinguish the two classes with an accuracy of 91.7{\%}, sensitivity of 90{\%} and specificity of 93.3{\%}. As a pre-analysis step, the EEG signals were tested for nonlinearity using surrogate data analysis and we found that there was a significant difference in the LLE measure of the actual data and the surrogate data.},

abstract = {The reconstruction of nonlinear dynamics from short ecological time series has been an attractive subject in ecology for the last two decade since May's classical work. Nonlinear time series analysis (NTSA) is used to investigate deterministic chaos. However, most ecological time series are too short to perform NTSA, which usually requires a time series whose size is in the thousands. Here we propose a way to reconstruct local dynamics from a very short ecological time series whose data point is smaller than ten. For most tree crops such as citrus, nuts and acorns, the yield alternates between high- and low-bearing years. Isagi et al. [Isagi Y, Sugimura K, Sumida A, Ito H. How does masting happen and synchronize? J Theor Biol 1997;187:231-9] proposed a mechanistic model that describes masting as chaos and can be applied to alternate bearing. Here we have used an ensemble data set consisting of the yields of 48 individual trees over seven years to test our proposed method and have successfully validated this method by a one-year forward prediction three times in 2002, 2003 and 2004. We also show the applicability of NTSA tools such as Lyapunov exponents, correlation dimension and deterministic nonlinear prediction on the reconstructed local dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The Vicon motion capture system was used to collect three-dimensional kinematic data of healthy volunteers (seven old subjects and ten young subjects) at different walking speed (80{\%}, 100{\%}, 120{\%} of the natural walking speed). The anterior-posterior and medio-lateral motions of the seventh cervical and tenth thoracic vertebrae, as well as the flexion-extension and abduction-adduction angles of the lower extremity joints, were obtained from 30 consecutive gait cycles to calculate the largest Lyapunov exponents and analyze the difference of gait stability between the old and young group and the influence of walking speed on gait stability. Results: The gait stability in the young group was better than that in the old group, and there were significant differences in certain motion segments (P{\textless}0.01). The gait stability in both groups were reduced with the increase of speed (P{\textless}0.05). Conclusions: The largest Lyapunov exponent based on nonlinear time series analysis method can be used to effectively and quantitatively analyze the gait stability of each motion segment in human during walking.},

We re-examined data on budmoth density, plant quality, and parasitism rates. Our results suggest that the effect of plant quality on budmoth density is weak. By contrast, a simple model of budmoth-parasitoid interaction accounts for 90{\%} of the variance in budmoth population growth rates.

While most of the chaotic systems reported in the literature are either confined to laboratories or theoretical models, this is another natural system showing chaotic behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The traditional approach in the time series analysis of nitrate concentration in rivers is the decomposition of the original dataset followed by the linear modelling of residuals. The linear models are usually represented by the autoregressive models or their combination with moving average models. However, the advances in the nonlinear time series analysis showed that by applying more sophisticated models better description of the original datasets could be achieved. A comparison of traditionally used linear models of the ARMA class and nonlinear regime-switching models represented by the MSW (Markov switching) and SETAR (Self-exciting threshold autoregressive) models is given on two Slovak rivers: the Hron and the V{\'{a}}h Rivers. In order to meet the requirement for stationarity of the analysed time series when using the linear models the original datasets had to be decomposed, using the additive decomposition, into trend, seasonal and cyclical components and the residuals, which were further used in the linear modelling. One of the big advantages of the nonlinear models with multiple regimes is that they do not require the modelled time series to be stationary and thus they were directly used to model original time series. The performance of particular models was then evaluated based on the minimal value of the sum of squares of the residuals and the visual assessment of the modelled and original time series. The analysis of two time series of monthly nitrate concentrations showed that mainly by using MSW models it is possible to improve the simplest linear model (AR(1)) by almost 75{\%} and achieve a very good visual description of the original time series without the need to maintain its stationarity.},

abstract = {Mobility is essentially based on successful balance control. The evaluation of functional strategies for postural stability is requisite for effective balance rehabilitation and fall prevention in elderly subjects. Our objective was to clarify control mechanisms of different standing positions reflecting challenges of typical everyday life situations. For this purpose, elderly subjects stood on different surfaces resulting in a change of the biomechanical constraints. Sway parameters out of time and frequency domain were calculated from center-of-pressure (COP) excursions. Besides the classic quantification of the amount of sway variability, we investigated the temporal organization of postural sway by means of nonlinear time series analysis. Limb load symmetry was quantified via foot pressure insoles. We found task dependent motor outputs: (1) asymmetrical loading in all conditions; (2) altered amount and structure of COP movements with dissimilar changes in medio-lateral and anterior-posterior direction; (3) changes of the motor output affect several time scales especially when standing on a balance board or with one foot on a step. Our results indicate that elderly subjects preferred forcefully one limb which supports a step-initiation strategy. Modifications of the postural sway structure refer to the interaction of multiple control mechanisms to cope with the altered demands. The identification of postural strategies employed in daily activities augments the ecological validity of postural control studies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

These descriptors are then employed to retrieve different versions of the same musical piece using a dynamic programming algorithm based on nonlinear time series analysis. First, we evaluate the accuracy obtained using individual descriptors, and then we examine whether perfor- mance can be improved by combining these music represen- tations (i.e. descriptor fusion). Our results show that whilst harmony is themost reliablemusic representation for version identification, the melody and bass line representations also carry useful information for this task.

The multiscale SSN is a type of hidden Markov model that takes into account both multiple states buried in the measurement and memory effects in the process of the observable whenever they exist. Most biological systems function in a nonstationary manner across multiple timescales. Combined with a recently established nonlinear time series analysis based on information theory, a simple scheme is proposed to deal with the properties of multiscale and nonstationarity for a discrete time series. We derived an explicit analytical expression of the autocorrelation function in terms of the SSN. To demonstrate the potential of our scheme, we investigated single-molecule time series of dissociation and association kinetics between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the plasma membrane and its adaptor protein Ash/Grb2 (Grb2) in an in vitro reconstituted system. We found that our formula successfully reproduces their autocorrelation function for a wide range of timescales (up to 3 s), and the underlying SSNs change their topographical structure as a function of the timescale; while the corresponding SSN is simple at the short timescale (0.033-0.1 s), the SSN at the longer timescales (0.1 s to {\~{}}3 s) becomes rather complex in order to capture multiscale nonstationary kinetics emerging at longer timescales. It is also found that visiting the unbound form of the EGFR-Grb2 system approximately resets all information of history or memory of the process.},

Experimentally observed intracellular calcium responses to different agonists show a variety of behaviors from simple spiking to complex oscillatory regimes. Here we study typical experimental traces of calcium oscillations in hepatocytes obtained in response to phenylephrine and ATP. The traces were analyzed with methods of nonlinear time series analysis in order to determine the stochastic/deterministic nature of the intracellular calcium oscillations. Despite the fact that the oscillations appear, visually, to be deterministic yet perturbed by noise, our analyses provide strong evidence that the measured calcium traces in hepatocytes are prevalently of stochastic nature. In particular, bursting calcium oscillations are temporally correlated Gaussian series distorted by a monotonic, instantaneous, time-independent function, whilst the spiking behavior appears to have a dynamical nonlinear component whereby the overall determinism level is still low. The biological importance of this finding is discussed in relation to the mechanisms incorporated in mathematical models as well as the role of stochasticity and determinism at cellular and tissue levels which resemble typical statistical and thermodynamic effects in physics.},

abstract = {The Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a representative signal containing information about the condition of the brain. The shape of the wave may contain useful information about the state of the brain. However, the human observer cannot directly monitor these subtle details. Besides, since bio-signals are highly subjective, the symptoms may appear at random in the time scale. Therefore, the EEG signal parameters, extracted and analyzed using computers, are highly useful in diagnostics. Chaotic measures like correlation dimension (CD), largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), Hurst exponent (H) and entropy are used to characterize the signal. Results indicate that these nonlinear measures are good discriminators of normal and epileptic EEG signals. These measures distinguish epileptic EEG and alcoholic from normal EEG with an accuracy of more than 90{\%}. The dynamical behavior is less random for alcoholic and epileptic compared to normal. This indicates less of information processing in the brain due to the hyper-synchronization of the EEG. Hence, the application of nonlinear time series analysis to EEG signals offers insight into the dynamical nature and variability of the brain signals. As a pre-analysis step, the EEG data is tested for nonlinearity using surrogate data analysis and the results exhibited a significant difference in the correlation dimension measure of the actual data and the surrogate data. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {The quantitative analysis of vocal disorders by nonlinear signal processing methods has been extensively used in the last two decades. In this work, two algorithms for nonlinear time-series analysis, Sample Entropy and cross-Sample Entropy, are used on electroglottogram (EGG) and microphone (MIC) signals recorded from 51 normal and 80 dysphonic subjects, to obtain summary measures of voice disorders through SampEn and cross-SampEn indices. Such parameters quantify, respectively, the degree of irregularity (in the sense of self-dissimilarity) within a time-series and of asynchrony (in the sense of cross-dissimilarity) between two distinct time-series. The aims of this work are: to determine if statistically significant differences in terms of signal irregularity quantified by SampEn occur between normal and pathological subjects, investigating whether or not such differences can be equally seen in EGG and MIC; to assess if cross-SampEn reveals different degrees of asynchrony between EGG and MIC signals in the two groups. Results show that SampEn in pathological subjects is higher than in normal subjects for both EGG and MIC time-series, with a statistically significant difference detectable from both signals (Pe {\textless} 10-4 for EGG and Pe {\textless} 10-7 for MIC). Cross-SampEn exhibits a statistically significant difference too, showing a higher degree of cross-dissimilarity between EGG and MIC time-series for pathological subjects (Pe {\textless} 10-4). In conclusion, SampEn and cross-SampEn well quantify the increase of complexity of both EGG and MIC signals and the decrease of their cross-similarity in presence of vocal disorders. Thanks to the complementarity of nonlinear indicators to the traditionally considered linear ones, SampEn and cross-SampEn appear as suitable candidates to enter the pool of approaches to investigate speech pathologies and to obtain potentially new insights on their nature. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This internet-based information technology offers an online collection of psychotherapy-related data and allows insights into therapeutic patterns of change without any time-delay. The classical pre-post-evaluation is completed by an assessment of therapeutic processes. Besides an internet-based data collection the Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) integrates different methods of nonlinear time series analysis and provides a visualization of results. Method: SNS is a new internet-based technology of data collection and data analysis. For illustration we present a single case study (avoidant personality disorder (DSM IV 301.82) with recurrent major depressive episodes) where SNS was applied in clinical practice (in-patient treatment). SNS results are used for therapy planning by repeated feedback interviews with the patients. Results: Critical phases and nonlinearities of the ongoing self-organization processes can be identified. In addition to the practical impact of real-time monitoring SNS allows for continuous process-outcome-research in naturalistic settings. Models of change processes (e.g. sudden gains) can be tested but also used as a interpretation frame of idiographic results. Conclusions: In every day practice SNS enhances transparency, self-efficacy of patients, and supports the motivation to change. Compliance of patients is high, and the data show high validity. Therefore as a future perspective SNS should become routine in clinical practice and be integrated in professional psychotherapy training. 2011 Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle.},

Results of experimental studies conducted on a spindle-bearing test bed have demonstrated that, as the working condition of the bearing deteriorates due to the initiation and/or progression of structural damages, the frequency information contained in the vibration signal becomes increasingly complex, leading to the increase of the RP entropy.

We perform the analysis for the ground accelerations recorded at 6 seismological stations: Grua, Ruda, Rada, Bara, Zaga and Bdva. The latter were carefully chosen based on their corresponding tectonic zone and the local geological setting. For each station, we analyze the horizontal component of the ground acceleration in the north-south direction, which is the one of primary interest for engineering design. We employ surrogate data testing and methods of nonlinear time series analysis. The obtained results indicate that strong ground accelerations are stochastic, in particular belonging to a class of linear stationary stochastic processes with Gaussian inputs or distorted by a monotonic, instantaneous, time-independent nonlinear function. This type of motion is detected regardless of the corresponding tectonic setting and the local geological conditions.

It was also observed higher values of the embedding dimension, m{\textgreater}9, and the Kaplan-Yorke dimension, DKY{\textgreater}2.9. Between samples, the behavior of $\lambda$m and DKY with increasing excitation current is quite different. Such a behavior is explained in terms of changes in the microstructure associated with the UCP. In addition, determinism tests indicated that the TBN masked determinist components, as inferred by |k→| values larger than 0.70 in most of the cases. Evidence on the existence of empirical attractors by reconstructing the phase spaces has been also found. All obtained results are useful indicators of the interplay between the uniaxial compacting pressure, differences in the microstructure of the samples, and the TBN signal dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis methods are used to investigate the dynamics of mechanical and convective turbulences in the atmospheric surface layer flow. Using dynamical invariant analysis (e.g. correlation dimension, Lyapunov exponent and mutual information) along with recurrence quantification analysis (e.g. recurrent rate, determinism, average diagonal length of recurrence plot, etc.) of the vertical wind component data, it is confirmed that a convective turbulence is a lower order manifold in its phase space exhibiting higher degree of organization than a mechanical turbulence. Applying a quasi-one-dimensional chaotic return map technique, the topological differences between the mechanical and convective turbulences are explored. These quasi-one-dimensional return maps are produced using the local maxima of the first principal component of the reconstructed turbulence data. A comparison of the probability distribution of the local maxima of a forced Lorenz model with the turbulence data indicates the possible existence of a stable fixed point for both type of turbulences. Furthermore, dynamically the mechanical turbulence is found to resemble an unforced Lorenz model whereas the convective turbulence resembles a forced Lorenz model.},

In addition to the bootstrap multiple sample based on the selected neighbour points implemented on the computer, another interval prediction method is described too.

Existing techniques based on linear and probabilistic models are not able to provide accurate prediction of the location patterns from a spatio-temporal perspective, especially for long-term estimation. More specifically, they are able to only forecast the next location of a user, but not his/her arrival time and residence time , i.e., the interval of time spent in that location. Moreover, these techniques are often based on prediction models that are not able to extend predictions further in the future. In this paper we present NextPlace, a novel approach to location prediction based on nonlinear time series analysis of the arrival and residence times of users in relevant places. NextPlace focuses on the predictability of single users when they visit their most important places, rather than on the transitions between different locations. We report about our evaluation using four different datasets and we compare our forecasting results to those obtained by means of the prediction techniques proposed in the literature. We show how we achieve higher performance compared to other predictors and also more stability over time, with an overall prediction precision of up to 90{\%} and a performance increment of at least 50{\%} with respect to the state of the art.},

abstract = {Introduction: Heart rate variability (HRV) has been used in clinical studies to determine alterations in heart function. The deleterious effects of smoking on the cardiovascular system have also been reported extensively. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that long term active exposure to tobacco smoke triggers an irreversible change in the adaptability of the cardiovascular system, and that this effect may be reflected in alterations of HRV. Methods: We applied a novel method from the field of nonlinear time series analysis on series of inter beat intervals, in order to characterize the predictability of the heart rate. There is a parameter, known as the maximal Lyapunov exponent (coefficient lambda), that can be interpreted as a measure of the adaptability of the cardiovascular system. By using multivariable regression models on this parameter, we were able to explore the association between HRV and tobacco smoke exposure. The datasets were part of the SAPALDIA (Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults) cohort study, which contains 24h ECG data for 1586 participants and information about tobacco smoke exposure and further covariates such as biometric and disease related variables. Results: The covariates cigarettes per day and pack-years were significantly associated with lower lambda coefficients, indicating higher predictability of heart rate among smokers. The effect was similar when we analyzed ex-smokers and current smokers separately. Conclusion: Smoking is associated with a significant increase in heart rate predictability, irrespectively of the current smoking status. Therefore, direct long term exposure to tobacco smoke may fundamentally affect the adaptability of the cardiovascular system.},

abstract = {The study of deterministic laws of evolution has characterized the development of science since Newton's times. Chaos, namely the manifestation of irregular and unpredictable dynamics (not random but look random [1]), entered the debate on determinism at the end of the 19th century with the discovery of sensitivity to initial conditions, meaning that small infinitesimal differences in the initial state might lead to dramatic differences at later times. Poincar{\'{e}} [2, 3] was the first to realize that solutions of the three-body problem are generically highly sensitive to initial conditions. At about the same time, this property was recognized in geodesic flows with negative curvature by Hadamard [4]. One of the first experimental observations of chaos, as understood much later, was when irregular noise was heard by Van der Pol in 1927 [5] while studying a periodically forced nonlinear oscillator. Nevertheless, it was only with the advent of digital computing that chaos started to attract the interest of the wider scientific community. After the pioneering investigation of ergodicity in a chain of nonlinear oscillators by Fermi, Pasta and Ulam in 1955 [6], it was in the early 1960s that the numerical studies of Lorenz [7] and H{\'{e}}non and Heiles [8] revealed that irregular and unpredictable motions are a generic feature of low-dimensional nonlinear deterministic systems. The existence and onset of chaos was then rigorously analyzed in several systems. While an exhaustive list of such mathematical proofs is beyond the scope of this preface, one should mention the contributions of Kolmogorov [9, 10], Chirikov [11], Smale [12], Ruelle and Takens [13], Li and Yorke [14] and Feigenbaum [15]. The characteristic Lyapunov exponents introduced by Oseledets in 1968 [16] are the fundamental quantities for measuring the sensitivity to initial conditions. Oseledets' work generalized the concept of Lyapunov stability to irregular trajectories building upon earlier studies of Birkhoff [17], von Neumann [18], Krylov [19]3 and Asonov and Sinai [20] on ergodic theory. Lyapunov exponents quantify exponential sensitivity to initial conditions and provide direct access to the entropy production in ergodic systems via the Pesin theory [21]. Further advances have been made possible by the introduction of proper physical invariant measures for certain dissipative systems due to Sinai [22], Ruelle [23] and Bowen [24, 25]. However, it was necessary to wait until the end of the 1970s before the independent works of Shimada and Nagashima [26] and Benettin et al [27] introduced the numerical algorithms required to compute Lyapunov exponents beyond the largest one. The availability of such algorithms and also, at about the same time, of those necessary for the computation of fractal dimensions and entropies by Grassberger and Procaccia [28], made possible the study of chaotic behavior in physically relevant models. Lyapunov analysis, applied to experimental systems [29], was also made possible by a combination of these numerical methods with ideas from nonlinear time series analysis [30]. As a result, it is nowadays widely recognized that Lyapunov exponents are a central tool of chaos theory, crucial for characterizing a number of interesting physical properties including dynamical entropies and fractal dimensions [31]. Their pivotal role in modern dynamical systems theory has been established by a fruitful exchange between a rigorous (and beautiful) mathematical theory and the algorithmic approaches essential for understanding many physical phenomena. From the 1990s to the present, with the concomitant progress in both theoretical understanding and computer capabilities, there has been a progressive shift of interest from low dimensional towards high dimensional systems. This shift towards dynamics characterized by many degrees of freedom, possibly spatially organized and/or with several characteristic temporal scales, has been accompanied by the need for generalizations of the Lyapunov exponents. Moreover, further attention has also been paid to the so-called Lyapunov vectors, which provide information on geometrical properties of the tangent space characterizing stable and unstable directions [23]. This approach could prove extremely useful in systems with many degrees of freedom such as the models used, for instance, in atmospheric physics, where different forms of Lyapunov vectors (both infinitesimal and of finite size) have been proposed to generate suitable perturbations to be used for optimizing ensemble forecasting methods [32]. While some of these tools are routinely used in standard applications, a comprehensive understanding of Lyapunov vectors and their relation to different properties of spatiotemporal chaos is still lacking. From this brief and largely incomplete historical tour it should be clear that Lyapunov analysis has had and still has a great impact on both fundamental and applied approaches to deterministic dynamical systems. Furthermore, some recent results have generated renewed attention on certain aspects of Lyapunov analysis and related applications in a number of different research communities. For instance, different types of Lyapunov vectors are regularly employed in the most diverse applications from applied mathematics and physics to atmospheric sciences. Depending on the context, researchers use covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), singular Lyapunov vectors, bred vectors, finite-time Lyapunov vectors, etc. Similarly, for the Lyapunov exponents several generalizations are possible to account for, e.g., the multifractal nature of the invariant measure, the local fluctuations of stretching rates (finite-time Lyapunov exponents), to characterize the nonlinear regime of perturbation evolution (finite-size Lyapunov exponents) or their spatiotemporal dynamics (co-moving Lyapunov exponents). All these quantities often have different physical interpretations, are characterized by different levels of mathematical development and only provide access to partial pieces of information. Moreover, the scattered state of the present literature, with key contributions published in journals read by different communities (mathematicians, nonlinear and statistical physicists, fluid dynamicists and geophysicists), makes it difficult to develop a general picture. This special issue aims to offer an up-to-date view of current research on Lyapunov analysis, discussing both its mathematical theory and its applications to a number of different problems. Moreover, in order to facilitate the comparison and exchange of ideas and tools among different fields of research, contributions (either original or topical reviews) from researchers working in different disciplines have been selected for this issue. After the compact review of the basic mathematical results on Lyapunov exponents by Lai-Sang Young, the special issue is organized into nine sections broadly focused on the following topics: Large deviations and rare trajectories. Lyapunov exponents are mean quantities which characterize the sensitivity to initial conditions of typical trajectories. A large deviation theory of their finite time fluctuations, however, is relevant for the construction of a thermodynamic formalism of deterministic chaos. Moreover, the weighted sampling of extreme fluctuations allows one to access rare trajectories and phase–space topological structures. Random matrices. Lyapunov exponents are suitable quantities to statistically characterize products of random matrices, with a number of applications to transfer matrix methods and, more generally, to the statistical mechanics of disordered systems. In particular, Lyapunov exponents have long played a central role in the theory of Anderson localization. These aspects are reviewed here, together with an original application to the transfer matrix. Covariant Lyapunov vectors: theory and applications. CLVs constitute an intrinsic tangent space decomposition into stable and unstable directions associated with Lyapunov exponents. Recently, novel and efficient algorithms for computing CLVs have become available, turning them into a practical tool for the study and characterization of chaotic dynamical systems, especially when many degrees of freedom are considered. Applications include—but are not limited to—the characterization of collective chaotic modes and the study of intermittency in shell models for turbulence. This section also includes a pedagogical discussion of CLVs in low dimensional Hamiltonian systems. Time series analysis. The computation of Lyapunov exponents from time series data is a very active field of research playing a crucial role in experimental studies, with applications ranging from nonlinear optics to neuroscience. The need to reconstruct a higher dimensional phase space from scalar or lower dimensional data poses fundamental issues, introducing spurious Lyapunov exponents and limiting the accuracy when quantities such as the Kaplan–Yorke-dimension or the Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy are concerned. Recent advances based on CLVs, however, may help in identifying such spurious exponents, increasing the accuracy of embedding techniques. Many-body systems. The study of many-body dynamical systems plays a fundamental role in the debate on the foundations of statistical physics. In this respect, the discovery of long wavelength tangent space modes associated with close-to-zero Lyapunov exponents, the so-called hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes, has raised hopes that a clear link could be established between hydrodynamic transport coefficients and microscopic dynamical properties. In this section, three contributions discuss Lyapunov analysis applied to many-body systems such as hard disks and lattices of interacting classical spins. Spatiotemporal chaos and hyperbolicity. Spatially extended chaotic systems pose a number of new issues when spatiotemporal chaos is considered, ranging from questions on its extensi},

abstract = {We use the methodology of singular spectrum analysis (SSA), principal component analysis (PCA), and multi-fractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA), for investigating characteristics of vibration time series data from a friction brake. SSA and PCA are used to study the long time-scale characteristics of the time series. MFDFA is applied for investigating all time scales up to the smallest recorded one. It turns out that the majority of the long time-scale dynamics, that is presumably dominated by the structural dynamics of the brake system, is dominated by very few active dimensions only and can well be understood in terms of low dimensional chaotic attractors. The multi-fractal analysis shows that the fast dynamical processes originating in the friction interface are in turn truly multi-scale in nature.},

abstract = {In the present work we approach the hydrodynamic problem of discriminating the state of the turbulent fluid region as a function of the distance from the axis of a turbulent jet axis. More specifically, we analyzed temperature fluctuations in vertical turbulent heated jets where temperature time series were recorded along a horizontal line through the jet axis. We employed data from different sets of experiments with various initial conditions out of circular and elliptical shaped nozzles in order to identify time series taken at the jet axis, and discriminate them from those taken near the boundary with ambient fluid using nonconventional hydrodynamics methods. For each temperature time series measured at a different distance from jet axis, we estimated mainly nonlinear measures such as mutual information combined with descriptive statistics measures, as well as some linear and nonlinear dynamic detectors such as Hurst exponent, detrended fluctuation analysis, and Hjorth parameters. The results obtained in all cases have shown that the proposed methodology allows us to distinguish the flow regime around the jet axis and identify the time series corresponding to the jet axis in agreement with the conventional statistical hydrodynamic method. Furthermore, in order to reject the null hypothesis that the time series originate from a stochastic process, we applied the surrogate data method.},

abstract = {Inference of causality is central in nonlinear time series analysis and science in general. A popular approach to infer causality between two processes is to measure the information flow between them in terms of transfer entropy. Using dynamics of coupled oscillator networks, we show that although transfer entropy can successfully detect information flow in two processes, it often results in erroneous identification of network connections under the presence of indirect interactions, dominance of neighbors, or anticipatory couplings. Such effects are found to be profound for time-dependent networks. To overcome these limitations, we develop a measure called causation entropy and show that its application can lead to reliable identification of true couplings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Calculation of the correlation dimension and the largest Lyapunov exponent from the PD sequence is used to illustrate the nonlinear characteristics of the PD behavior in the electrical tree growth. The results provide strong evidence for the existence of deterministic chaos in the PD phenomenon of electrical trees, where the correlation dimension and the largest Lyapunov exponent are related with the PD activity of the tree growth, rather than a presence of random stochastic process. The fluctuating correlation dimension of the PD sequence during the branch-pine tree growth is associated with the transition of PD patterns and the change of the channel conductivity of the tree structure. It is also found that the nonlinear dynamics characteristics of the PD sequence are influenced by the applied voltage, the channel conductivity and the electrical tree shape. A possible mechanism is presented for the formation of different chaotic extents of typical electrical trees in XLPE cable insulation.},

abstract = {In a smooth input/output process y = f (x), if the input data x ??? R d is noise free and only the output data y is corrupted by noise, then a near optimal smooth model over(g, ??) will be a close approximation to f. However, as previously observed, for example in [H. Kantz, T. Schreiber, Nonlinear Time Series Analysis, 2nd ed., Cambridge Univ. Press, 2004], if the input data is also corrupted by noise then this is no longer the case. With noise on the inputs, the best predictive smooth model based on noisy data need not be an approximation to the actual underlying process; rather, the best predictive model depends on both the underlying process and the noise. A corollary of this observation is that one cannot readily infer the nature of a process from noisy data. Since almost all data has associated noise this conclusion has some unsettling implications. In this note we show how these effects can be quantified using the Gamma test. In particular we examine the Gamma test analysis of noisy time series data. We show that the noise level on the best predictive smooth model (based on the noisy data) can be much higher than the noise level on individual time series measurements, and we give an upper bound for the first in terms of the second. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, this longitudinal case study presents a new approach to characterizing the dynamics of infant limb and vocalization behaviors. A single infant's vocalizations and limb movements were recorded from 51-days to 305-days of age. On each recording day, accelerometers were placed on all four of the infant's limbs and an audio recorder was worn on the child's chest. Using nonlinear time series analysis methods, such as recurrence quantification analysis and Allan factor, we quantified changes in the stability and multiscale properties of the infant's behaviors across age as well as how these dynamics relate across modalities and effectors. We observed that particular changes in these dynamics preceded or coincided with the onset of various developmental milestones. For example, the largest changes in vocalization dynamics preceded the onset of canonical babbling. The results show that nonlinear analyses can help to understand the functional co-development of different aspects of infant behavior.},

Recently, the development of methodologies to extract the effective features still remains a primary challenge. Previous studies have demonstrated that the SEMG signals have nonlinear characteristics. In this study, by combining the nonlinear time series analysis and the time-frequency domain methods, we proposed the wavelet-based correlation dimension method to extract the effective features of SEMG signals. The SEMG signals were firstly analyzed by the wavelet transform and the correlation dimension was calculated to obtain the features of the SEMG signals. Then, these features were used as the input vectors of a Gustafson-Kessel clustering classifier to discriminate four types of forearm movements. Our results showed that there are four separate clusters corresponding to different forearm movements at the third resolution level and the resulting classification accuracy was 100{\%}, when two channels of SEMG signals were used. This indicates that the proposed approach can provide important insight into the nonlinear characteristics and the time-frequency domain features of SEMG signals and is suitable for classifying different types of forearm movements. By comparing with other existing methods, the proposed method exhibited more robustness and higher classification accuracy.},

The explanation commonly advanced for this phenomenon is that the distribution of Web server requests may be heavy-tailed. However, there is another possible explanation: self-similarity can also arise from deterministic, chaotic processes. To our knowledge, this possibility has not previously been investigated, and so existing studies on Web workloads lack an adequate comparison against this alternative. We conduct an empirical study of workloads from two different Web sites: one public university, and one private company, using the largest datasets that have been described in the literature. Our study employs methods from nonlinear time series analysis to search for chaotic behavior in the web logs of these two sites. While we do find that the deterministic components (i.e. the well-known "weekend effect") are significant components in these time series, we do not find evidence of chaotic behavior. Predictive modeling experiments contrasting heavy-tailed with deterministic models showed that both approaches were equally effective in modeling our datasets. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: Over the past decade, there have been resurgences and large-scale outbreaks of mumps worldwide. Little evidence is available on the relationship between meteorological factors and the incidence of mumps. We aimed to explore the effects of meteorological factors on mumps incidence. Methods: A Poisson regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used to evaluate the association between meteorological factors and the mumps incidence in Guangzhou, China, 2005-2012. Results: Nonlinear relationships between meteorological factors, except sunshine hours, and mumps incidence were observed. The relative risks (RRs) of mean temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure were 1.81 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.41 to 2.32), 1.28 (95{\%} CI, 1.02 to 1.59), and 0.80 (95{\%} CI, 0.67 to 0.95) comparing the 99th percentile to the median of their own, respectively. For wind velocity, the RR was 0.70 (95{\%}CI, 0.54 to 0.91) comparing the 1st percentile to the median. The hot effect and cold effect were larger in females than in males, and the hot effect increased with age. Conclusions: Mean temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity and atmospheric pressure might be important predictors of the mumps incidence. Tropical cyclone caused a higher increase in mumps cases. Our findings highlight the need to strengthen the awareness of using protective measures during typhoon days and allocating more attention to the susceptible populations during the summer.

So far, the performance of these measures to presage instability has been tested on a few laboratory setups, without mutual comparison of the different approaches. In this work a variety of measures are tested on a laboratory scale burner for validation and comparison. An atmospheric, partially premixed methane-fueled bluff-body stabilized burner is operated at 20 kW, showing stable and limit cycle oscillation operation for varying equivalence ratio. Focus is on an early and robust detection of an impending instability, suitable for on-line monitoring. Two data sets of acoustic pressure are considered, with different acoustic damping. Monotonicity and unambiguity of the stability margins are investigated. Additionally a surrogate data analysis is conducted, showing evidence of a nonlinear underlying dynamical system. However, these nonlinearities are found to have no significant influence on the predictions by methods that are based on nonlinear time series analysis.},

We also introduce nonlinear time series analysis methods and provide examples where these have advantages over linear methods.

Some examples include noninvasive assessment of autonomic function in patients with chronic kidney disease, dialysis-dependent renal failure and renal transplantation. Time series models and analysis methods have been utilized in the characterization of mechanisms of renal autoregulation and to identify the interaction between different rhythms of nephron pressure flow regulation.

Such chaotic elements can be the result of parameter shift in their individual dynamical systems and may lead to abnormal functions of the network. To accurately identify the chaotic neurons may thus be necessary and important, for example, applying appropriate controls to bring the network to a normal state. However, due to couplings among the nodes, the measured time series, even from non-chaotic neurons, would appear random, rendering inapplicable traditional nonlinear time-series analysis, such as the delay-coordinate embedding method, which yields information about the global dynamics of the entire network. Our method is based on compressive sensing. In particular, we demonstrate that identifying chaotic elements can be formulated as a general problem of reconstructing the nodal dynamical systems, network connections and all coupling functions, as well as their weights. The working and efficiency of the method are illustrated by using networks of non-identical FitzHugh–Nagumo neurons with randomly-distributed coupling weights.},

abstract = {This study proposes a forecast skill scheme for winter temperatures in the central Mediterranean Sub- regional Area. An original series of mean winter (December to February) temperatures spanning the period 1698–2010 is the basis for developing long-term climate prediction. A procedure was identified where a predictable structure was first provided by reducing noise via the Empirical Mode Decomposition method and then an Ensemble Climate Pre- diction (ECP) was applied. The predictability limit of the decomposed series was assessed by applying a collection of methods from linear and nonlinear time series analysis (Hurst coefficients, Lyapunov exponents and wavelet pat- terns). The analysis was based on a set of tools that are suitable to discover the manifestation of a possible trajectory of projected temperature change. The progress of the winter temperature forecast was inferred by an Exponential Smoothing with a Damped (ESD) multiplicative trend mod- el. ECP-ESD hindcast experiments were tested and ensem- ble forecasts run until the year 2040. ECP-ESD yields an ensemble mean path that consists: (1) of a sharp decline in winter temperature in the current decade; (2) more wide- spread predictions for 2020–2030, with fluctuations near the present multi-decadal average; and (3) a sharp warming for the 2030–2040 decade.

Comparison of the correlation dimension of the state variable of the mill (the load) embedded in phase space suggested that the dynamic behavior of the mill could not be represented by a linear stochastic model (Gaussian or otherwise). The low dimensionality (≤2) of the correlation dimension further suggested that the mill load depended on a few variables only and that the underlying generative process had a significant deterministic component. In addition, the operational variables could be used as reliable predictors in a neural network model to identify the controlled states of the mill. As a complementary approach to visualization of the operation of the mill, a different neural network model could be used to reconstruct a corrected power load curve by compensating for the effect of varying operating conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Several methods derived from nonlinear time series analysis have been suggested to quantify stability in human gait kinematics. One of these methods is the definition of the maximum finite time Lyapunov exponent (lambda) that quantifies how the system responds to infinitesimal perturbations. However, there are fundamental limitations to the conventional definition of lambda for gait kinematics. First, exponential increase in initial perturbations cannot be assumed since real-life perturbations of gait kinematics are finite sized. Second, the transitions between single and double support phase within each stride cycle define two distinct dynamical regimes that may not be captured by a single lambda. The present article presents a new method to quantify intra-stride changes lambda(t) in local dynamical stability and employs the method to 3D lower extremity gait kinematics in 10 healthy adults walking on a treadmill at 3 different speeds. All participants showed an intra-stride change in lambda(t) in the transition between single and double support phase. The intra-stride change reflected an both a increase and decrease in lambda(t) at heel strike and toe off, respectively, with increased gait speed. Furthermore, a close relationship was found between the intra-stride change in standard deviation of foot velocity in the anterior-posterior direction and the intra-stride change of the initial perturbations. The present results indicate that local dynamical stability has gait phase-dependent changes that are not identified by conventional computation of a single lambda.},

abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis (NTA) was employed to identify determinism in soil failure patterns observed in tillage (soil cutting). As soil consists of large numbers of particles, one may expect soil failure to be described adequately as a stochastic process. However, clear spatial patterns are sometimes observed in tillage operation, associated with a predominant spatial frequency in the power spectrum of the soil cutting force data (Glancey et al., 1989, Glancey and Upadhyaya, 1995). We applied NTA to soil failure data to distinguish deterministic chaos from stochastic processes such as (1/f)$\alpha$ fluctuations. We established four different soil conditions by controlling soil compactness and moisture. Deterministic chaos was identified only in tilled and dry soil. We reached this conclusiony,-by combining nonlinear deterministic prediction, Wayland test, Lyapunov spectrum and surrogate algorithms. We also recognized the difficulty of distinguishing deterministic chaos from (1/f)$\alpha$ fluctuations, and improved the discrimination by introducing a comparison between the autocorrelation and NDP functions.},

abstract = {We focus on earthquakes that were recorded in Serbia between 1970 and 2011 within shallow parts of the Earth's crust, having local magnitudes from the 1.2-5.8 interval. The main goal of the performed analysis is to examine whether the temporal sequence of these recorded magnitudes exhibits some deterministic pattern or whether it simply represents a series of random events. For this purpose, the temporal distribution of earthquake magnitudes above the magnitude of completeness is analyzed by means of nonlinear time series analysis and surrogate data testing, as well as by means of the autocorrelation function. Piece-wise low cross-prediction errors, with 75{\%} of segment pairs having the error smaller than its average value, indicate stationary properties of the examined sequence. Results of surrogate data testing indicate high zeroth-order prediction error that is independent of prediction time for the original dataset and 20 different surrogates, implying that the observed magnitude sequence is a series of independent random events drawn from some fixed but unknown distribution. These findings are supported further by a low value of the determinism factor for an earthquake treated as a system with four degrees of freedom (epicentral latitude and longitude, hypocentral depth and magnitude). The randomness in observed data is indicated further by the properties of the autocorrelation function, whose values for different time lags fall within the 95{\%} confidence limit without an apparent pattern. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Several nonlinear characteristic parameters, such as Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimension etc., are extracted. The results show that the eddy current magnetic field of the Al-alloy weld has distinguished chaotic features. Analysis of the Lempel-Ziv complexity and approximate entropy for different signals leads to the conclusion that these two complex measures are sensitive to the eddy current magnetic field of the weld zone.

abstract = {Potential paleoclimatic driving mechanisms acting on human evolution present an open problem of cross-disciplinary scientific interest. The analysis of paleoclimate archives encoding the envir-onmental variability in East Africa during the past 5 Ma has trig-gered an ongoing debate about possible candidate processes and evolutionary mechanisms. In this work, we apply a nonlinear sta-tistical technique, recurrence network analysis, to three distinct marine records of terrigenous dust flux. Our method enables us to identify three epochs with transitions between qualitatively differ-ent types of environmental variability in North and East Africa dur-ing the (i) Middle Pliocene (3.35–3.15 Ma B.P.), (ii) Early Pleistocene (2.25–1.6 Ma B.P.), and (iii) Middle Pleistocene (1.1–0.7 Ma B.P.). A deeper examination of these transition periods reveals potential climatic drivers, including (i) large-scale changes in ocean currents due to a spatial shift of the Indonesian throughflow in combination with an intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, (ii) a global reorganization of the atmospheric Walker circulation in-duced in the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean, and (iii) shifts in the dominating temporal variability pattern of glacial activity during the Middle Pleistocene, respectively. A reexamination of the avail-able fossil record demonstrates statistically significant coincidences between the detected transition periods and major steps in homi-nin evolution. This result suggests that the observed shifts be-tween more regular and more erratic environmental variability may have acted as a trigger for rapid change in the development of humankind in Africa. African climate ∣ Plio-Pleistocene ∣ climate-driven evolution ∣ dynamical transitions ∣ nonlinear time series analysis R ecent comparisons of terrestrial and marine paleoclimate ar-chives have resulted in an intense debate concerning global vs. regional forcing of East Africa's climate and its relationship to human evolution during the past 5 Ma (1–4). The gradual long-term retreat of equatorial rain forests and the emergence of drier environments in East Africa (2, 5, 6) were interrupted by distinct epochs of increased humidity indicated by paleo-lake levels in dif-ferent basins of the East African Rift System (EARS) displaying synchronous highs at about 2.7–2.5, 1.9–1.7, and 1.1–0.9 Ma B.P. (7). Notably, these epochs coincide well with certain global-scale climate transitions like the final closure of the Panama isthmus (8–10), intensification of the atmospheric Walker circulation (11), and the shift from a predominance of obliquity-driven glacial variability (41 ka period) to glacial-interglacial cycles with a 100 ka period (12, 13). Further reconstructions revealed addi-tional relevant lake periods at 4.7–4.3, 4.0–3.9, 3.4–3.3, and 3.2– 2.95 Ma B.P. (3). Previous findings suggest that the dominating summer aridity in the East African climate was controlled mainly by orbitally driven changes in the local irradiation driving regional monsoon activity via changes of sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) (5, 14–18) rather than by high-latitude glacial dynamics. In addi-tion, tectonic activity and the resulting complex topography of East Africa could have triggered particularly variable climate conditions during the Plio-Pleistocene (18, 19). As early as Darwin (20), scholars have speculated on if and how climate change shaped human evolution (4). On the basis of the present-day knowledge of the Plio-Pleistocene African climate, three general hypotheses concerning mechanisms of climate-induced mammalian evolutionary processes are currently discussed (18): (i) The turnover pulse hypothesis postulates progressive habitat changes (21, 22) due to abrupt climate shifts (1, 2) enforcing the adaptation of existing and the evolution of new species. (ii) The variability selection hypothesis proposes an increasing instability of environmental conditions as a driver for the simultaneous emergence of species (23, 24). (iii) Finally, the pulsed climate variability hypothesis promotes spikes of more vari-able climate conditions unrelated to high-latitude glacial cycles as a key driver of evolutionary selection (3, 6, 7, 25). With the cur-rently available paleoclimate and paleoanthropological records, it has not been possible to provide clear evidence for one of these hypotheses by means of traditional (linear) statistical analysis. Although there is an unequivocal correlation of terrestrial and marine paleoclimate records, to date, marine sediments (Fig. 1) provide the only archive that allows the study of the Plio-Pleis-tocene African climate on all relevant time scales. However, earlier analyses of terrigenous dust flux records using traditional time series analysis techniques to detect important transitions in the African climate yielded contradictory results with respect to the signature and timing of these events (1, 2, 17). Difficulties like these are to be expected when applying linear methods to the highly nonlinear climate system underlying paleoclimate proxy records. Linear techniques of time series analysis by definition are limited to the study of linear dynamics. To circumvent this problem and explore the vast remainder of nonlinear phenom-ena, here we present results on the basis of a nonlinear method of time series analysis, recurrence network (RN) analysis (see SI Text). RN analysis enables us to reliably detect qualitative changes within observational time series, which are largely indiscernible for linear methods of data analysis (26–28). This instrument leads to an improved detection of a particular flavor of Plio-Pleistocene African climate change and its potential influence on the habitats of early humans. On the basis of concepts of dynamical systems and graph theory, RN analysis is particularly efficient in applica-tions where the number of observations is limited and the data points are unevenly spaced, which is common for paleoclimate proxy records such as time series of dust accumulation rates (29).},

Based on the concept of state-space reconstruction, this set of methods allows us to compute characteristic quantities such as Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions, to predict the future course of the time series, and even to reconstruct the equations of motion in some cases. In practice, however, there are a number of issues that restrict the power of this approach: whether the signal accurately and thoroughly samples the dynamics, for instance, and whether it contains noise. Moreover, the numerical algorithms that we use to instantiate these ideas are not perfect; they involve approximations, scale parameters, and finite-precision arithmetic, among other things. Even so, nonlinear time-series analysis has been used to great advantage on thousands of real and synthetic data sets from a wide variety of systems ranging from roulette wheels to lasers to the human heart. Even in cases where the data do not meet the mathematical or algorithmic requirements to assure full topological conjugacy, the results of nonlinear time-series analysis can be helpful in understanding, characterizing, and predicting dynamical systems.},

One of the latter was measured in the infrared tail of optical fiber supercontinua, the other in the fluence profiles of multifilaments. All three data sets exhibit extreme-value statistics and exceed the significant wave height in the respective system by a factor larger than two. Nonlinear time series analysis indicates a different degree of determinism in the systems. The optical fiber scenario is found to be driven by quantum noise whereas rogue waves emerge as a consequence of turbulence in the others. With the large number of rogue events observed in the multifilament system, we can systematically explore the predictability of such events in a turbulent system. We observe that rogue events do not necessarily appear without a warning, but are often preceded by a short phase of relative order. This surprising finding sheds some new light on the fascinating phenomenon of rogue waves.},

In previous studies the photoplethysmogram was claimed to be driven by deterministic chaos [Tsuda 1992, Sumida 2000]; however, the methods applied for chaos detection were noise sensitive and inconclusive. Therefore, to reach a consistent conclusion it is important to employ additional nonlinear time series analysis tools that can test different features of the signal's underlying dynamics.

Because somatosensory noise has been shown to reduce postural sway, we hypothesized that noise from the auditory modality might have a similar effect. Given that the nervous system uses noise to optimize signal transfer, adding mechanical or auditory noise should lead to increased feedback about sensory frames of reference used in balance control. In the present experiment, postural sway was analyzed in healthy young adults where they were presented with continuous white noise, in the presence and absence of visual information. Our results show reduced postural sway variability (as indexed by the body's center of pressure) in the presence of auditory noise, even when visual information was not present. Nonlinear time series analysis revealed that auditory noise has an additive effect, independent of vision, on postural stability. Further analysis revealed that auditory noise reduced postural sway variability in both low- and high-frequency regimes ({\textgreater} or {\textless}0.3 Hz) of sway, suggesting that both spontaneous and feedback-driven aspects of postural fluctuations were influenced by acoustic noise. Our results support the idea that auditory white noise reduces postural sway, suggesting that auditory noise might be used for therapeutic and rehabilitation purposes in older individuals and those with balance disorders.},

Recurrence, determinism, entropy, distance of activity patterns, and correlation in correspondence to spike and burst parameters (e.g., mean spiking rate, mean bursting rate, burst duration, spike in burst, etc.) have been computed to characterize and assess the daily changes of the neuronal electrophysiology during neuronal network development and maturation. The results show the similarities/differences between several channels and time periods as well as the evolution of the spontaneous activity in the MEA chip. RPs could be used for graphically exploring possible neuronal dynamic breaking/changing points, whereas RQA parameters are suited for locating them. The combination of RQA with traditional approaches improves the identification, description, and prediction of electrophysiological changes and it will be used to allow intercomparison between results obtained from different MEA chips. Results suggest the proposed processing paradigm as a valuable tool to analyze neuronal activity for screening purposes (e.g., toxicology, neurodevelopmental toxicology).},

With so many different models of scale-free networks it is unclear what properties of scale-free networks are typical, and what properties are peculiarities of a particular growth or construction process. We propose a simple maximum entropy process which provides the best representation of what are typical properties of scale-free networks, and provides a standard against which real and algorithmically generated networks can be compared. As an example we consider preferential attachment and find that this particular growth model does not yield typical realizations of scale-free networks. In particular, the widely discussed "fragility" of scale-free networks is actually found to be due to the peculiar "hub-centric" structure of preferential attachment networks. We provide a method to generate or remove this latent hub-centric bias - thereby demonstrating exactly which features of preferential attachment networks are atypical of the broader class of scale-free networks. We are also able to statistically demonstrate whether real networks are typical realizations of scale-free networks, or networks with that particular degree distribution; using a new surrogate generation method for complex networks, exactly analogous the widely used surrogate tests of nonlinear time series analysis.},

This study evaluates possible differences of GPi linear and nonlinear neuronal discharge characteristics between patients with dystonia and TS. Nine patients with primary dystonia and six patients with TS were studied during functional stereotactic neurosurgical operations for implantation of DBS electrodes under general anesthesia. Six patients with primary dystonia under local anesthesia served as non-anesthetized controls. Single-unit activity recordings in the GPi were obtained during routine microelectrode recording and mapping to delineate nuclear borders and to identify the sensorimotor subregions. Anesthesia profoundly decreased neuronal activity in patients with dystonia. Dystonia patients showed marginally higher mean firing rates in the GPi compared to TS patients (P = 0.06). Although the average total number of bursts and the mean peak frequency in bursts did not differ between groups, the mean spikes in bursts were higher in dystonia patients (P {\textless} 0.05). Nonlinear time series analysis metrics, measured as complexity of Lempel-Ziv and maximum approximate entropy, revealed higher randomness in TS compared to dystonia patients (P {\textless} 0.05). The percentage of oscillating neurons in spike trains was higher in dystonia compared to TS (P {\textless} 0.05).

abstract = {A systematic computational approach to describe the conformational dynamics of biomolecules in reduced dimensionality is presented. The method is based on (i) the decomposition of a high-dimensional molecular dynamics trajectory into a few "system" and (many) "bath" degrees of freedom and (ii) a Langevin simulation of the resulting model. Employing principal component analysis, the dimension of the system is chosen such that it contains all slow large-amplitude motions of the molecule, while the bath coordinates only account for its high-frequency fluctuations. It is shown that a sufficiently large dimension of the model is essential to ensure a clear time scale separation of system and bath variables, which warrants the validity of the memory-free Langevin equation. Applying methods from nonlinear time series analysis, a practical Langevin algorithm is presented which performs a local estimation of the multidimensional Langevin vector fields describing deterministic drift and stochastic driving. Adopting a 800 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the folding of heptaalanine in explicit water, it is shown that a five-dimensional Langevin model correctly reproduces the structure and conformational dynamics of the system. The virtues and limits of the approach are discussed in some detail.},

Recently, e-recurrence networks have been proposed as a tool to analyse the structural properties of a time series. In this paper, we propose the applicability of local and global e-recurrence network measures to distinguish between chaotic and stochastic dynamics using paradigmatic model systems such as the Lorenz system, and the chaotic and hyper-chaotic Rossler system. We also demonstrate the effect of increasing levels of noise on these network measures and provide a real-world application of analysing electroencephalographic data comprising epileptic seizures. Our results show that both local and global e-recurrence network measures are sensitive to the presence of unstable periodic orbits and other structural features associated with chaotic dynamics that are otherwise absent in stochastic dynamics. These network measures are still robust at high noise levels and short data lengths. Furthermore, e-recurrence network analysis of the real-world epileptic data revealed the capability of these network measures in capturing dynamical transitions using short window sizes. e-recurrence network analysis is a powerful method in uncovering the signatures of chaotic and stochastic dynamics based on the geometrical properties of time series.},

abstract = {In this study, variation in the characteristics of the pressure oscillations in a thermoacoustic engine is explored as the input heat flux is varied. A bifurcation diagram is plotted to study the variation in the qualitative behavior of the acoustic oscillations as the input heat flux changes. At a critical input heat flux (60 Watt), the engine begins to produce acoustic oscillations in its fundamental longitudinal mode. As the input heat flux is increased, incommensurate frequencies appear in the power spectrum. The simultaneous presence of incommensurate frequencies results in quasiperiodic oscillations. On further increase of heat flux, the fundamental mode disappears and second mode oscillations are observed. These bifurcations in the characteristics of the pressure oscillations are the result of nonlinear interaction between multiple modes present in the thermoacoustic engine. Hysteresis in the bifurcation diagram suggests that the bifurcation is subcritical. Further, the qualitative analysis of different dynamic regimes is performed using nonlinear time series analysis. The physical reason for the observed nonlinear behavior is discussed. Suggestions to avert the variations in qualitative behavior of the pressure oscillations in thermoacoustic engines are also provided.},

abstract = {This experimental study focuses on characterizing the nonlinear combustion dynamics prior to blowout in a partially premixed combustor with a swirl-stabilized burner. Experiments were performed by varying the global equivalence ratio from 0.92 to 0.33. The acquired time-series data of pressure fluctuations were analyzed using nonlinear time-series analysis. When the combustor was operated at an equivalence ratio of 0.92, broadband low-amplitude pressure oscillations called combustion noise were observed. As the equivalence ratio is decreased to 0.62, the oscillations change their characteristics from low-amplitude broadband oscillations to high-amplitude discrete tones, and the combustor undergoes limit-cycle oscillations. A sharp peak is observed in the amplitude spectra of the acoustic pressure oscillations at this stage. On reducing the equivalence ratio to 0.42 and lower, the periodic motion is interrupted by occasional irregular bursts and the system switches back and forth between the noisy (periodic) and quiet (aperiodic) zones. In the dynamical systems theory parlance, this irregular switching between periodic and aperiodic behaviors is termed intermittency. On reducing the equivalence ratio further, the system reaches blowout condition. Intermittency can be used as the signature prior to flame blowout. The dynamical patterns and inherent nonlinearity during the transition from chaotic behavior to intermittent burst oscillations prior to blowout are shown qualitatively by drawing phase portraits, return maps, and recurrence plots.

abstract = {Automotive disc brake squeal is fugitive, transient and remains difficult to predict. In particular, instantaneous mode squeal observed experimentally does not seem to be associated with mode coupling and its mechanism is not clear. The effects of contact pressures, friction coefficients as well as material properties (pressure and temperature dependency and anisotropy) for brake squeal propensity have not been systematically explored. By analysing a finite element model of an isotropic pad sliding on a plate similar to that of a previously reported experimental study, pad modes have been identified and found to be stable using conventional complex eigenvalue analysis. However, by subjecting the model to contact pressure harmonic excitation for a range of pressures and friction coefficients, a forced response analysis reveals that the dissipated energy for pad modes is negative and becomes more negative with increasing contact pressures and friction coefficients, indicating the potential for instabilities. The frequency of the pad mode in the sliding direction is within the range of squeal frequencies observed experimentally. Nonlinear time series analysis of the vibration velocity also confirms the evolution of instabilities induced by pad modes as the friction coefficient increases. By extending this analysis to a more realistic but simple brake model in the form of a pad-on-disc system, in-plane pad-modes, which a complex eigenvalue analysis predicts to be stable, have also been identified by negative dissipated energy for both isotropic and anisotropic pad material properties. The influence of contact pressures on potential instabilities has been found to be more dominant than changes in material properties owing to changes in pressure or temperature. Results here suggest that instantaneous mode squeal is likely caused by in-plane pad-mode instabilities.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. Self-sustained oscillatory dynamics is a motion along a stable limit cycle in the phase space, and it arises in a wide variety of mechanical, electrical, and biological systems. Typically, oscillations are due to a balance between energy dissipation and generation. Their stability depends on the properties of the attractor, in particular, its dissipative characteristics, which in turn determine the flexibility of a given dynamical system. In a network of oscillators, the coupling additionally contributes to the dissipation, and hence affects the robustness of the oscillatory solution. Here, we therefore investigate how a heterogeneous network structure affects the dissipation rate of individual oscillators. First, we show that in a network of diffusively coupled oscillators, the dissipation is a linearly decreasing function of the node degree, and we demonstrate this numerically by calculating the average divergence of coupled Hopf oscillators. Subsequently, we use recordings of intracellular calcium dynamics in pancreatic beta cells in mouse acute tissue slices and the corresponding functional connectivity networks for an experimental verification of the presented theory. We use methods of nonlinear time series analysis to reconstruct the phase space and calculate the sum of Lyapunov exponents. Our analysis reveals a clear tendency of cells with a higher degree, that is, more interconnected cells, having more negative values of divergence, thus confirming our theoretical predictions. We discuss these findings in the context of energetic aspects of signaling in beta cells and potential risks for pathological changes in the tissue.},

In this study, pressure fluctuation data acquired from an experimental combustor prone to high-frequency combustion instabilities are systematically analyzed to investigate the characteristics of its combustion stability. Once combustion instability occurs, its onset can be identified by an abrupt increase in the root-mean-square value of the pressure fluctuations, and the characteristic frequencies of its sustaining pressure waves have been estimated using Fourier analysis. The application of the nonlinear time series analysis provides meaningful information from data measured before combustion instability occurs. The average mutual information for the determination of the time lag of a state vector shows distinctly different values depending on the eventual occurrence of combustion instability. The dimensions for unfolding any nonlinear structure in the phase space are estimated as five for both cases from the false nearest neighbor analysis. The results, shown as phase space plots constructed in a three-dimensional phase space, reveal contrasting structures closely related to the occurrence of high-frequency combustion instability, which implies that a prediction of combustion instability could be made based upon the analysis results using data taken before its occurrence.},

Rolling elements bearings are one of the most common components used in expensive, high precision and critical machines such as gas turbines, rolling mills and gyroscopes. They can be subjected to various defects which could lead to catastrophic results. This includes inner and outer race defects and hence it is of interest to analyze the system response under such defects. A better understanding of the system performance under such defects can be beneficial when performing system diagnostics and system design. In this paper we are focused on the outer race defect and perform a comparative nonlinear time series analysis of a healthy system and a defective system. We consider various levels of outer race defects. The analysis is based on the recurrence properties of the system in its reconstructed state space. After determining the appropriate time lags through the average mutual information technique and the corresponding embedding dimensions through the false neighbor technique, we perform a sequential analysis of the system by subdividing the time series into bins and investigating the system response through recurrence quantification analysis parameters along with the entropy. This contributes to the enhancement of the science of diagnostics of outer race defects by analyzing the signature of various recurrence quantification analysis parameters as the system goes from a healthy state to a severely defective state.},

However, accurate LQP is difficult because of the dynamic nature of wireless environments. A recent study found that fluctuations in intermediate quality links often show dynamics on a sub-second granularity, making the task even more challenging. In order to leverage the intermediate links, as well as fine-tune upper-layer protocols, we propose to use nonparametric modeling in nonlinear time series analysis that predicts short-term link quality online. Unlike existing studies, we do not define any new experimental or hypothetical models, or train models using a set of training data. Functional-coefficient autoregression is employed to predict the link dynamics at high time resolutions. We apply our approach and a local linear regression-based LQP (a typical parametric modeling approach) to both NS-2 simulation and empirical packet traces. The results indicate that the proposed method has much higher prediction accuracy and convergence speed than the local linear regression-based LQP under dynamic network conditions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple and novel approach, based on nonlinear time series analysis of an experimental system, to infer from subtle alteration of the system dynamics the changes caused in the system parameters. Using the acceleration time-series as a measurement of simulated and experimental impact oscillators (serving as a model for the drilling conditions with intermittent contact between the drill- bit and the formation), the systems attractor is reconstructed and characterised. It is shown that the stiffness correlates with the topology of the reconstructed attractor. Non-impacting trajectories form an approximate plane within the three dimensional reconstructed phase-space, and contact with the constraint causes a systematic deviation from the linear subspace, the inclination of which, measured by the statistics of the tangent vector, can be used to infer the stiffness. This relationship between the topology of attractor and the stiffness was also verified experimentally. Based on the developed framework, it is now possible to classify the stiffness of the impacted material from a single variable in a simple way and in real time.},

The research aimed at determination of the influence of gait speed on the LLE value with a view to verification of the belief that slower walking leads to increased stability characterized by smaller LLE value. Analyses were focused on the time series representing hip flexion/extension angle, knee flexion/extension angle and dorsiflexion/plantarflexion dimension of the ankle. Gait sequences were recorded in the Human Motion Laboratory (HML) of the Polish- Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Bytom by means of the Vicon system. Application of the AC5000M treadmill allowed recordings in three variants: at the preferred walking speed (PWS) of each subject, at 80{\%} of the PWS and at 120{\%} of the PWS. According to the recommendations from the literature the LLE value was estimated twice for every time series: as the short-term LLE1 for the first stride and as the long-term LLE4−10 over a fixed interval between the fourth and the tenth stride. In the latter case it was confirmed that the LLE value increases with walking speed for both limbs. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

We used nonlinear time series analysis to determine (1) the presence of nonlinear dynamics in fish populations on Georges Bank, (2) the minimum number of dimensions required to effectively describe system dynamics, (3) the strength of patterns of co-predictability among all possible pairs of fish species, and (4) identification of groups of species characterized by similar dynamics. Here, nonlinear behavior refers to non-equilibrium dynamics, including chaos. The population trajectories of all 26 species exhibited strong density-dependent feedback as indicated by a Partial Rate Correlation Function analysis. Significant evidence of complex dynamical behavior was found for approximately 1 in 5 species. Low dimensionality for many of the individual series was identified, suggesting that for a given level of predictability, this system can be represented by a relatively small number of critically important ecological variables. Further, we found high levels of co-predictability among pairwise combinations of individual species. We identified 4 major species groups sharing similar dynamic features on the basis of patterns of co-predictability, and explored potential mechanisms for interpreting the groupings in terms of trophic interactions and life history characteristics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In general, Economy is a vast and complicated set of arrangements and actions wherein agents-consumers, firms, banks, investors, government agencies-buy and sell, speculate, trade, oversee, bring products into being, offer services, invest in companies, strategize, explore, forecast, compete, learn, innovate, and adapt. As a result the economic and financial variables such as foreign exchange rates, gross domestic product, interest rates, production, stock market prices and unemployment exhibit large-amplitude and aperiodic fluctuations evident in complex systems.

abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis is becoming a more and more reliable tool for the study of complicated dynamics from measurements. The concept of low-dimensional chaos has proven to be fruitful in the understanding of many complex phenomena despite the fact that very few natural systems have actually been found to be lowdimensional deterministic in the sense of the theory. In order to evaluate the long term usefulness of the nonlinear time series approach as inspired by chaos theory, it will be important that the corresponding methods become more widely accessible. This paper, while not a proper review on nonlinear time series analysis, tries to make a contribution to this process by describing the actual implementation of the algorithms, and their proper usage. Most of the methods require the choice of certain parameters for each specific time series application. We will try to give guidance in this respect. The scope and selection of topics in this article, as well as the implementational choices that have been made, correspond to the contents of the software package TISEAN which is publicly available from http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/ ˜tisean. In fact, this paper can be seen as an extended manual for the TISEAN programs. It fills the gap between the technical documentation and the existing literature, providing the necessary entry points for a more thorough study of the theoretical background.},

Phase space reconstructions were created from the time series and then estimates for the largest Lyapunov exponent were calculated. The time delays used in the phase space reconstructions were determined using average mutual information while the proper embedding dimensions were chosen according to the method of false nearest neighbours. Quantitative information on the behaviour of the flow and the CCV was acquired from three-dimensional phase space reconstructions. Introduced modifications to the flow were clearly visible in the phase space reconstructions of energy and dissipation, indicating that these quantities are appropriate for monitoring and analysing the state of the system. The estimates for the largest Lyapunov exponents were positive for almost all time series, indicating chaotic dynamics. The permutation spectrum test was used to confirm the chaoticity of the CCV. The present results indicate that the used methods offer a promising new framework for characterising the CCV from the viewpoint of nonlinear time series analysis.},

At seasonal and inter-seasonal timescales, the summer monsoon of one hemisphere is linked via outflows from the winter monsoon of the opposing hemisphere. Long-term phase relationships between the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the Indonesian–Australian summer monsoon (IASM) are poorly understood, raising questions of long-term adjustments to future greenhouse-triggered climate change and whether these changes could 'lock in' possible IASM and EASM phase relationships in a region dependent on monsoonal rainfall. Here we show that a newly developed nonlinear time series analysis technique allows confident identification of strong versus weak monsoon phases at millennial to sub-centennial timescales. We find a see–saw relationship over the last 9,000 years—with strong and weak monsoons opposingly phased and triggered by solar variations. Our results provide insights into centennial-to millennial-scale relationships within the wider EAIASM regime.},

abstract = {{\"{i}}¿½ 2016 Author(s). In the standard two-electrode configuration employed in electrolytic process, when the control dc voltage is brought to a critical value, the system undergoes a transition from conventional electrolysis to contact glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE), which has also been referred to as liquid-submerged micro-plasma, glow discharge plasma electrolysis, electrode effect, electrolytic plasma, etc. The light-emitting process is associated with the development of an irregular and erratic current time-series which has been arbitrarily labelled as "random," and thus dissuaded further research in this direction. Here, we examine the current time-series signals measured in cathodic CGDE configuration in a concentrated KOH solution at different dc bias voltages greater than the critical voltage. We show that the signals are, in fact, not random according to the NIST SP. 800-22 test suite definition. We also demonstrate that post-processing low-pass filtered sequences requires less time than the native as-measured sequences, suggesting a superposition of low frequency chaotic fluctuations and high frequency behaviors (which may be produced by more than one possible source of entropy). Using an array of nonlinear time-series analyses for dynamical systems, i.e., the computation of largest Lyapunov exponents and correlation dimensions, and re-construction of phase portraits, we found that low-pass filtered datasets undergo a transition from quasi-periodic to chaotic to quasi-hyper-chaotic behavior, and back again to chaos when the voltage controlling-parameter is increased. The high frequency part of the signals is discussed in terms of highly nonlinear turbulent motion developed around the working electrode.},

Criteria concern the ecological momentary assessment, the assessment of therapy-related cognitions and emotions, equidistant time sampling, real-time nonlinear time series analysis, continuous participative process control by client and therapist, and the application of idiographic (person-specific) surveys. Methods: The process-outcome monitoring is technically realized by an internet-based device for data collection and data analysis, the Synergetic Navigation System. Its feasibility is documented by a compliance study on 151 clients treated in an inpatient and a day-treatment clinic. Results: We found high compliance rates (mean: 78.3{\%}, median: 89.4{\%}) amongst the respondents, independent of the severity of symptoms or the degree of impairment. Compared to other diagnoses, the compliance rate was lower in the group diagnosed with personality disorders. Conclusion: The results support the feasibility of high-frequency monitoring in routine psychotherapy settings. Daily collection of psychological surveys allows for the assessment of highly resolved, equidistant time series data which gives insight into the nonlinear qualities of therapeutic change processes (e.g., pattern transitions, critical instabilities).},

Nonlinear time series analysis has been widely used to search for signatures of low-dimensional chaos in light curves emanating from astrophysical bodies. A particularly popular example is the microquasar GRS 1915+105, whose irregular but systematic X-ray variability has been well studied using data acquired by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. With a view to building simpler models of X-ray variability, attempts have been made to classify the light curves of GRS 1915+105 as chaotic or stochastic. Contrary to some of the earlier suggestions, after careful analysis, we find no evidence for chaos or determinism in any of the GRS 1915+105 classes. The dearth of long and stationary data sets representing all the different variability classes of GRS 1915+105 makes it a poor candidate for analysis using nonlinear time series techniques. We conclude that either very exhaustive data analysis with sufficiently long and stationary light curves should be performed, keeping all the pitfalls of nonlinear time series analysis in mind, or alternative schemes of classifying the light curves should be adopted. The generic limitations of the techniques that we point out in the context of GRS 1915+105 affect all similar investigations of light curves from other astrophysical sources.},

abstract = {Software reliability growth models attempt to forecast the future reliability of a software system, based on observations of the historical occurrences of failures. This allows management to estimate the failure rate of the system in field use, and to set release criteria based on these forecasts. However, the current software reliability growth models have never proven to be accurate enough for widespread industry use. One possible reason is that the model forms themselves may not accurately capture the underlying process of fault injection in software; it has been suggested that fault injection is better modeled as a chaotic process rather than a random one. This possibility, while intriguing, has not yet been evaluated in large-scale, modern software reliability growth datasets. We report on an analysis of four software reliability growth datasets, including ones drawn from the Android and Mozilla open-source software communities. These are the four largest software reliability growth datasets we are aware of in the public domain, ranging from 1200 to over 86,000 observations. We employ the methods of nonlinear time series analysis to test for chaotic behavior in these time series; we find that three of the four do show evidence of such behavior (specifically, a multifractal attractor). Finally, we compare a deterministic time series forecasting algorithm against a statistical one on both datasets, to evaluate whether exploiting the apparent chaotic behavior might lead to more accurate reliability forecasts.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore novel multipollutant exposure assessments using the Air Quality Health Index in relation to emergency department visits for otitis media (OM). This study was a retrospective analysis using information from emergency department visits for OM, air pollution, and weather databases. For children 3 years of age or younger, there were 4,815 emergency department visits for OM over a 6-year period across hospitals in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Both time-stratified case-crossover and nonlinear time series distributed lag analyses were applied to investigate the association between the Air Quality Health Index and visits for OM. Using case-crossover analysis, there was an increase in emergency department visits with OM diagnoses 6 to 7 days postexposure to increased ozone and 3 to 4 days after exposure to increased particulate matter. For every 1 unit increase in the Air Quality Health Index, discharge diagnosis of OM increased 5{\%} to 6{\%} three days postexposure. Effects were stronger using the nonlinear time series analysis. The overall risk for OM, in the first 15 days after an increase in the Air Quality Health Index, was 1.22 times the risk of OM on days following no increase in exposures. These findings confirm that there is an association between the multipollutant Air Quality Health Index and emergency department visits for OM. The findings can be used to inform risk communication, patient education, and policy. Clinicians can use the Air Quality Health Index as an education and advocacy tool to promote and protect the health of those at high risk for OM to reduce exposures.},

abstract = {Abstract Marine ecosystems are increasingly recognized as exhibiting the principal hallmarks of complex systems, including the possibility of sudden shifts in state among alternative basins of attraction and both periodic and aperiodic dynamical behavior. Over the last several decades a well-defined theory of complexity has emerged integrating earlier (and inter-related) concepts based on catastrophe, bifurcation, and chaos theory. In this review, we trace aspects of the historical development of these ideas and their application to marine systems. The manifestations of nonlinear dynamics in marine ecosystems include regime shifts; mirage correlations in which causally-connected system components can appear to be in-phase, asynchronous, or anti-correlated over different stanzas of time; and related state-dependent behavior in which the response of a focal variable to a driver differs depending on the present state of the system. We describe the analytical underpinnings of each of these dynamical behaviors. Although nonlinear dynamical systems are often portrayed in a deterministic setting, we emphasize the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in which an underlying nonlinear system acts as a noise amplifier in the presence of random perturbations. We next review the tools available for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems based on the concept of state-space reconstruction and the application of techniques in nonlinear time series analysis. Finally, we address the management implications of nonlinear dynamics in exploited marine species and argue that considerations of predictability and forecast skill can serve as effective criteria for model selection and inference.},

We recently argued [Lindner et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114 (2015) 054101] that the Kepler data includes "golden" stars, whose luminosities vary quasiperiodically with two frequencies nearly in the golden ratio, and whose secondary frequencies exhibit power-law scaling with exponent near -1.5, suggesting strange nonchaotic dynamics and singular spectra. Here we use a series of phenomenological models to make plausible the connection between golden stars and fractal spectra. We thereby suggest that at least some features of variable star dynamics reflect universal nonlinear phenomena common to even simple systems.},

abstract = {The speech-evoked auditory brainstem response (sABR) shows how complex sounds such as speech and music are processed in the auditory system. Speech-ABR could be used to evaluate particular impairments and improvements in auditory processing system. Many researchers used linear approaches for characterizing different components of sABR signal, whereas nonlinear techniques are not applied so commonly. The primary aim of the present study is to examine the underlying dynamics of normal sABR signals. The secondary goal is to evaluate whether some chaotic features exist in this signal. We have presented a methodology for determining various components of sABR signals, by performing Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) to get the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, composite multiscale entropy (CMSE), the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and deterministic nonlinear prediction are computed for each extracted IMF. EEMD decomposes sABR signal into five modes and a residue. The CMSE results of sABR signals obtained from 40 healthy people showed that 1st, and 2nd IMFs were similar to the white noise, IMF-3 with synthetic chaotic time series and 4th, and 5th IMFs with sine waveform. LLE analysis showed positive values for 3rd IMFs. Moreover, 1st, and 2nd IMFs showed overlaps with surrogate data and 3rd, 4th and 5th IMFs showed no overlap with corresponding surrogate data. Results showed the presence of noisy, chaotic and deterministic components in the signal which respectively corresponded to 1st, and 2nd IMFs, IMF-3, and 4th and 5th IMFs. While these findings provide supportive evidence of the chaos conjecture for the 3rd IMF, they do not confirm any such claims. However, they provide a first step towards an understanding of nonlinear behavior of auditory system dynamics in brainstem level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Quality of Service (QoS) is considered as an important factor to determine the success of a Web Service. Currently, many QoS prediction approaches focus on time series models. However, these approaches only consider linear and nonlinear time series. Analysis of real QoS datasets shows that they are characterized by other behaviors. Incomplete characteristics analysis of existing prediction approaches will result in wrong prediction results. Furthermore, the collected QoS values may miss some data, which will also impact the prediction accuracy. RBF (Radial Basis Function) neural network model can manage the complex linear and nonlinear relationship, with great flexibility and adaptability. Therefore, we propose a novel combinational prediction approach for QoS based on RBF, which chooses the optimal model from the established linear or nonlinear prediction model, and dynamic gray prediction model according to the data characteristics. Next, the predicted results of these models are passed into the RBF training model as the input, and then used for prediction. Using a public QoS dataset and four real-world QoS datasets, we evaluate the proposed approach by comparing it with previous approach. The experimental results show that our approach is better and improves the accuracy and validity.},

abstract = {Small leakages are severe threats to the long distance pipeline transportation. An online small leakage detection method based on chaos characteristics and Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) is proposed in this paper. For the first time, the relationship between the chaos characteristics of pipeline inner pressures and the small leakages is investigated and applied in the pipeline detection method. Firstly, chaos in the pipeline inner pressure is found. Relevant chaos characteristics are estimated by the nonlinear time series analysis package (TISEAN). Then LS-SVM with a hybrid kernel is built and named as hybrid kernel LS-SVM (HKLS-SVM). It is applied to analyze the chaos characteristics and distinguish the negative pressure waves (NPWs) caused by small leaks. A new leak location method is also expounded. Finally, data of the chaotic Logistic-Map system is used in the simulation. A comparison between HKLS-SVM and other methods, in terms of the identification accuracy and computing efficiency, is made. The simulation result shows that HKLS-SVM gets the best performance and is effective in error analysis of chaotic systems. When real pipeline data is used in the test, the ultimate identification accuracy of HKLS-SVM reaches 97.38{\%} and the position accuracy is 99.28{\%}, indicating that the method proposed in this paper has good performance in detecting and locating small pipeline leaks.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Author(s).Most random processes studied in nonlinear time series analysis take values on sets endowed with a group structure, e.g., the real and rational numbers, and the integers. This fact allows to associate with each pair of group elements a third element, called their transcript, which is defined as the product of the second element in the pair times the first one. The transfer entropy of two such processes is called algebraic transfer entropy. It measures the information transferred between two coupled processes whose values belong to a group. In this paper, we show that, subject to one constraint, the algebraic transfer entropy matches the (in general, conditional) mutual information of certain transcripts with one variable less. This property has interesting practical applications, especially to the analysis of short time series. We also derive weak conditions for the 3-dimensional algebraic transfer entropy to yield the same coupling direction as the corresponding mutual information of transcripts. A related issue concerns the use of mutual information of transcripts to determine coupling directions in cases where the conditions just mentioned are not fulfilled. We checked the latter possibility in the lowest dimensional case with numerical simulations and cardiovascular data, and obtained positive results.},

abstract = {Noise contamination in experimental data with underlying chaotic dynamics is one of the significant problems limiting the application of many nonlinear time series analysis methods. Although numerous studies have been devoted to the investigation of different aspects of noise-nonlinear dynamics interactions, the effects produced by noise on chaotic dynamics are not fully understood. This study sought to analyze the local effects produced by noise on chaotic dynamics with a smooth attractor. Local Wayland test translation errors were calculated for noise-induced Lorenz and R�ssler chaotic models, and for experimental green light photoplethysmogram data. Results demonstrated that under noise induction, local regions on the chaotic attractor with high values of local translation error can be observed. This phenomenon was defined as the local noise sensitivity. It was found that for both models, local noise-sensitive regions were located close to the system's equilibrium points. Additionally, it was found that the reconstructed dynamics represent well the local noise sensitivity of the original dynamics. The concept of local noise sensitivity is expected to contribute to various applied studies, as it reveals regions of chaotic attractors that are sensitive to the presence of noise. c 2016 Author(s).},

Our study aims to applying complexity measures derived from nonlinear time series analysis in order to characterize LS-pAF in terms of organization and to identify patients in whom AF can be terminated from those in whom AF cannot be terminated by step-CA within the LA. A total of 33 consecutive patients (age 61 +/- 7 years, sustained AF duration 19 +/- 11 months) with LS-pAF underwent step-CA. The organization of right bipolar electrograms before and during the ablation procedure was assessed using the coarse-grained correlation dimension. LS-pAF was terminated into sinus rhythm or atrial tachycardia in 22 patients during step-CA within the LA (left terminated patients-LT). In 11 patients the ablation procedure failed to terminate AF within LA (not left terminated patients-NLT). The statistical analysis of the estimated coarse-grained correlation dimension revealed that a higher right atrial (RA) organization before step-CA was associated to AF termination within the LA. During the ablation procedure, the level of RA organization displayed distinctive evolution between LT and NLT patients with a significant organization increase before AF termination for the LT patients.},

abstract = {The electrophysiological alterations in nerves due to diabetes are classically studied in relation to their instantaneous frequency, conduction velocity and amplitude. However, analysis of amplitude variability may reflect the occurrence of feedback loop mechanisms that adjust the output as a function of its previous activity could indicate fractal dynamics. We assume that a peripheral neuropathy, such as that evoked by diabetes, the inability to maintain a steady flow of sensory information is reflected as a breakdown of the long range power-law correlation of CAP area fluctuation from cutaneous nerves. To test this, we first explored in normal rats whether fluctuations in the trial-to-trial CAP area showed a self-similar behavior or fractal structure by means of detrended fluctuations analysis (DFA), and Poincare plots. In addition, we determine whether such CAP fluctuations varied by diabetes induction. Results showed that CAP area fluctuation of SU nerves evoked in normal rats present a long term correlation and self-similar organization (fractal behavior) from trial to trial stimulation as evidenced by DFA of CAP areas. However, CAPs recorded in diabetic nerves exhibited significant reductions in area, larger duration and increased area variability and different Poincare plots than control nerves. The Hurst exponent value determined with the DFA method from a series of 2000 CAPs evoked in diabetic SU nerves was smaller than in control nerves. It is proposed that in cutaneous nerves of normal rats variability of the CAP area present a long term correlation and self-similar organization (fractal behavior), and reflect the ability to maintain a steady flow of sensory information through cutaneous nerves. Nevertheless, this is not the case for sural nerves of diabetic rats which is reflected as a breakdown of the long range power-law correlation of CAP area fluctuation. Nonlinear time series analysis of CAP area fluctuations is a valuable new insight tool that can be used for the study of alterations in transmission of sensory information in humans suffering diabetes or under other demyelination diseases.},

abstract = {Many complex and interesting phenomena in nature are due to nonlinear phenomena. The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called 'chaos theory', has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages. Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results in terms of 'functional sources' and 'functional networks' allows the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i) normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated with normal information processing, whereas both hyper-as well as hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing and disturbed consciousness.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we concentrate on a mapping from time series to graphs, the visibility algorithm introduced by Lacasa et al. [1]. In order to cite some of its most relevant features, we will stress its intrinsic nonlocality, low computational cost, straightforward implementation, and quite " simple " way of inheriting the time series properties in the structure of the associated graphs. These features will make it easier to find connections between the underlying processes and the networks obtained from them by a direct analysis of the latter. In particular, in this chapter, we will focus the implementation of the algorithm of visibility to three known routes to chaos. We will define a graph entropy and process of renormalization for visibility graphs that characterize these routes and analyze the relationship between the flow of renormalization and the extremes of the entropy function. Disregarding any underlying process, we can consider a time series just as an ordered set of values and transform this set into a different mathematical object with the aids of an abstract mapping [2, 3]. We can then ask which properties of the original set are conserved, which are transformed and how, what can we say about one of the mathematical representations just by looking at the other. This exercise is of mathematical interest by itself. In addition, it turns out that time series or signals is a universal method of extracting information from dynamical systems in any field of science. Therefore, the preceding mathematical mapping gains some unexpected practical interest as it opens the possibility of analyzing a time series from an alternative point of view. Of course, the relevant information stored in the original time series should be somehow conserved in the mapping. The motivation is completed when the new representation belongs to a relatively mature mathematical field, where information encoded in such a representation can be effectively disentangled and processed. This is, precisely, the first motiva-tion to map time series into networks. This motivation is increased by two interconnected factors: (i) Although a mature field, time series analysis has some limitations, when it refers to study the so-called complex signals. Beyond the linear regime, there exists a wide range of phenomena, which are usually embraced in the field of the so-called complex systems. Dynamical phenomena such as chaos, long-range correlated stochastic processes, intermittency, and multifractality are examples of complex phenomena, where time series analysis is pushed to its own limits. Nonlinear time series analysis develops from techniques such as nonlinear correlation functions, embedding algorithms, multrifractal spectra, and projection theorem tools that increase in complexity parallel to the complexity of the process/series under study. New approaches to deal with complexity are not only welcome, but needed. Approaches dealing with the intrinsic nonlinearity by being intrinsically nonlinear in turn deal with the possible multiscale character of the underlying process by being designed to naturally incorporated multiple scales, and such is the framework of networks, of graph theory. (ii) The technological era brings us the possibility to digitally analyze myriads of data in a glimpse. Massive data sets can nowadays be parsed, and with the aid of well-suited algorithms, we can gain access and filter data from many processes, let it be of physical, technological, or even social garment.},

abstract = {The Maple package TimeS for time series analysis has a new feature and an improvement in forecasting by phase space reconstruction. An optional argument in the computational routines that allows the researcher to choose the different number of steps ahead to forecast. This update extends the running of the package with this new feature for the current versions of the Maple software too. New version program summary Program Title:TimeS Program Files doi:10.17632/nhtmjc8yp8.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3 Programming language: Maple17 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 185 (2014) 1115 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. Nature of problem: Time series analysis and improving forecast capability. Solution method: The method of solution is published in [1]. Reasons for the new version: For a phenomenon described by an unknown low-dimensional dynamical system defined by a set of coupled differential equations ẋi=fi(x),i=1,{\ldots},n, one generates a map M for which the time variable is increased by $\delta$t:xi(P+1)=Fi(x(P),$\delta$t). Though another map M¯ that approaches M, X¯i(P+1) is close to xi(P+1) when $\delta$t→0 [1]. X¯i(P+1)=F¯i(x(P),$\delta$t)=∑k=0N In the reconstruction's scheme by delays method [2], x(P) is state vector reconstructed. Its components have regular spacings in the time series. The approach X¯i(P+1) corresponds to the prediction for the value xi(P+1) [3]. If one applies $\delta$t→$\tau$$\delta$t' in the mapping (1), then X¯i(P+$\tau$)=F¯i(x(P),$\tau$$\delta$t')=∑Xk[xi(P)]. This application enables the choose for different times of prediction, e.g., in chaotic time series [4]. So, other entries beyond the nearest neighbor to the last known value can be predicted and analyzed. Here, we extend the capacity of forecasting and analysis of the computational routines by means the optional argument called PT. It corresponds to parameter $\tau$ in the mapping (2). The researcher can include this option in the commands GfiTS, ForecasTS and IforecasTS. In the NIforecasTS command, our package was already trying to tackle a similar calculation. But it employs the global mapping corresponding to the next entry in the time series, i.e., only the parameter $\tau$=1 take part in the global fitting. The program predicts the N steps by the next step (corresponding to N=1) and using it as the N=2 data and so on, up to the actual value of N that we are trying to forecast. Because this different conception, the routines NIforecasTS, AnalysTS and GrafiTS have not changed with respect to their running. The use of the commands in this version of the TimeS package closely follows the previous version. But the programming logistic in the GifTS routine required an update for the correct running of the new features in the current versions of the Maple software. We considered our internal procedure gerpoly deprecated–it does not work properly in the Maple 17 release–and it has been deleted in this version. The polynomials are now generated inside the GfiTS routine. There is a change in the optional argument that selects the part of the time series for the global mapping. The choosing now refers to the last vector to be used in the global mapping. The argument IniPoint was substituted by Final for all routines in this update. The goal of this new option is to relate more easily the global mapping with the position on the time series of interest in the forecasting. Another slight modification is present for the error calculation by the optional argument Poptions. Instead of the percent error, this analysis option now prints the actual error. Let us consider the same time series of the original paper [1]. It is stored in the file ‘ts37.txt' and corresponds to the dynamical variable X of the Lorenz System [5]. Below, we present the Maple worksheet for the reconstruction of phase space, the global mapping, the forecasting and the improvement of the forecast. The respective routines in this example are VecTS, GfiTS, ForecasTS and IforecasTS. The date to be forecast is dat[402]. [Figure presented] −0.03991323747X12+0.1157254791X1X2−0.05432130896X1X3−0.03977733053X22+0.03040753173X2X3−0.005038168581X32+1.487438057X1−0.3816889428X2+0.09738575830X3 [Figure presented] 9.2926021229.231602460 [Figure presented]9.2926021229.278554589. Thus, for the forecasting and analysis of the second entry in a given time series (i.e., $\tau$=2), the argument is PT=2 and so on. In order to compare the same prediction by the command NIforecasTS, we put its respective prompt too: [Figure presented] 9.333733567. The argument Nsteps=2 specifies the parameter $\tau$=2 and the map Mapag[1] corresponds to $\tau$=1 above. In this application, the prediction with the new feature in the IforecasTS is more accurate–9.279 compared to 9.333 for the true value 9.293–than the result of the command NIforecasTS. Besides being an alternative for improved accuracy, the new feature enlarges the possibilities in time series analysis by the TimeS package. Summary of revisions: Modification of the way the polynomials needed are generated, making the running of the program compatible with the new version (release 17 up) Maple; The introduction of the possibility of the calculating for the prediction N steps ahead that improved our previous similar calculation; Instructions to use the TimeS package (README.pdf), computational routines (TimeS.txt) and test file (TimeS.mw). Restrictions: If the time series that is being analyzed presents a great amount of noise or if the dynamical system behind the time series is of high dimensionality (Dim≫3), then the method may not work well. Unusual features: Our implementation can, in the cases where the dynamics behind the time series is given by a system of low dimensionality, greatly improve the forecast. Running time: It depends strongly on the command used. [1] H. Carli, L.

abstract = {The financial markets activity is a worldwide subject of numerous
studies and analyses, which use a variety of methods and research tools.
Such methods may be found, inter alia, in the field of relatively new
but rapidly developing knowledge, which gives the chance to study the
prediction of chaotic time series in different branches of economics. It
means that the approach derived from the analysis of the nonlinear
deterministic systems can be applied successfully to study the
fluctuations of stock exchange market on the level of individual
(micro-), company (mezzo-) and macro-economy. Taking into account the
fact that the functioning of stock exchanges varies due to different
legal regulations, the attempt to assess the impact of the sustainable
growth strategy, on the investment decisions seems to be interesting.
Therefore, in this study we present the application of Recurrence Plots
and Recurrence Quantification Analysis for the purpose of exploration of
time series describing the stock quotes of the companies from the energy
sector. Besides, in the study there is an attempt to answer the question
if there are any differences in the profile of the green energy
companies and the conventional energy ones that can be noticed using the
methods of nonlinear time series analysis. Interestingly, the outcomes
of the analyses indicate slightly more predictable character of stock
exchange quotations for eco energy producers},

abstract = {An investigation into the effect of coding scheme choice for sample entropy analysis of communications data is presented. Semantic content and speaker encoding of transmissions are explored. The results suggest a scheme with a greater number of categories will more likely pass surrogate testing, whether through finer distinctions of semantic categorization or through the additions of a speaker-content interaction. The results also suggest the way semantic categories are formed affects how well the scheme permits discrimination between workload conditions with a known effect. Teams and teamwork play an important role in completing many recreational and work tasks. One important team behaviour that may influence team effectiveness is team coordination (Kozlowski {\&} Ilgen, 2006), which is routinely assessed through examination of team communications (e.g., verbal utterances, text-chat) between team members (Cooke, Gorman {\&} Rowe, 2009). Recently, nonlinear time series analysis techniques, which can be used to characterise the degrees of temporal variation (or complexity) in complex rhythmic signals, have been successfully applied to team communications data. These approaches provide new insights into team communication dynamics while complementing information derived from other more "established" analytical approaches (Gorman, Cooke, Amazeen {\&} Fouse, 2012; Strang, et al, 2012). In general, results from these recent studies have described findings that align with a theory of optimal complexity (Stergiou, Harbourne {\&} Cavanaugh, 2006; Stergiou {\&} Decker, 2011), which posits complex rhythmic systems exhibit optimal and efficient performance when they exhibit a combination of both deterministic (predictable) and stochastic (unpredictable) behaviour, i.e., systems are optimal when they exhibit simultaneous stability and flexibility. Sample entropy (SEn; Richman {\&} Moorman, 2000) is one nonlinear time series technique popular for assessing the degree of complexity in complex rhythmic systems (e.g., stock market trends, heart rhythm, human postural sway). Briefly, SEn quantifies the log-likelihood that matches of sequences of length m in a time series will also match for the length m+1. The consequence is a time series comprised of perfectly repeating sequences will result in a SEn of 0, whereas a time series comprised of random data containing few, or no, repeating sequences will result in a SEn approaching m. Because of its computational simplicity, ability to be reliably applied to relatively short times series (x {\textgreater} 50), and easy application to assessing both continuous and categorical data, SEn is an attractive choice for researchers attempting to obtain a global index of temporal rhythm in team communications data. Interestingly, in a recent analysis of team communications data using SEn obtained from Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) operators performing a high-fidelity simulated Air Battle Management (ABM) exercise, Strang et al. (2014) showed time series length and the number of semantic categories included in a discrete coding scheme can affect the ability of SEn to meaningfully quantify temporal complexity in team communication data. Specifically, Strang and colleagues demonstrated 30 team verbal utterances were necessary for meaningful quantification of SEn for data encoded by Radio Channel (where separate channels were used only for specific purposes, for example, 'Safety' versus 'Strike'), 50 team utterances for data encoded by Speaker (i.e., which operator was talking), and 60 team utterances when data was encoded by both Speaker and Channel (i.e., which operator was talking and what channel that transmission was made on). A practical implication of this finding is researchers considering SEn analysis of short communication time series (e.g., due to the duration or complexity of a mission) may need to consider the number of categories in their coding schemes relative to the number of data points in those series. In a more theoretically motivated study, Strang et al. (2012) showed SEn applied to categorically coded team communications data could be used to discriminate when teams were performing a simulated low-fidelity ABM task under high or low workload. Specifically, teams under high workload were shown to exhibit lower SEn (lower complexity) in their communications data than teams exposed to lower workload. Strang and colleagues posited this may be due to a reduction in the number of semantic categories teams used for communicating when constrained by higher task demands.},

Although InDDeCs can realize faster computation and more accurate short-term prediction, it is still not well-known whether InDDeCs can be used in other applications of nonlinear time series analysis in which reconstruction is needed for the underlying dynamics from a scalar time series generated from a dynamical system. Here, we give theoretical support for justifying the use of InDDeCs and provide numerical examples to show that InDDeCs can be used for various applications for obtaining the recurrence plots, correlation dimensions, and maximal Lyapunov exponents, as well as testing directional couplings and extracting slow-driving forces. We demonstrate performance of the InDDeCs using the weather data. Thus, InDDeCs can eventually realize "dimensionless embedding" while we enjoy faster and more reliable computations.},

abstract = {Rotavirus is a common viral infection among young children. As in many countries, the infection dynamics of rotavirus in the Netherlands are characterized by an annual winter peak, which was notably low in 2014. Previous study suggested an association between weather factors and both rotavirus transmission and incidence. From epidemic theory, we know that the proportion of susceptible individuals can affect disease transmission. We investigated how these factors are associated with rotavirus transmission in the Netherlands, and their impact on rotavirus transmission in 2014. We used available data on birth rates and rotavirus laboratory reports to estimate rotavirus transmission and the proportion of individuals susceptible to primary infection. Weather data were directly available from a central meteorological station. We developed an approach for detecting determinants of seasonal rotavirus transmission by assessing nonlinear, delayed associations between each factor and rotavirus transmission. We explored relationships by applying a distributed lag nonlinear regression model with seasonal terms. We corrected for residual serial correlation using autoregressive moving average errors. We inferred the relationship between different factors and the effective reproduction number from the most parsimonious model with low residual autocorrelation. Higher proportions of susceptible individuals and lower temperatures were associated with increases in rotavirus transmission. For 2014, our findings suggest that relatively mild temperatures combined with the low proportion of susceptible individuals contributed to lower rotavirus transmission in the Netherlands. However, our model, which overestimated the magnitude of the peak, suggested that other factors were likely instrumental in reducing the incidence that year.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Using a homemade optical measuring system, time series related to two‐phase flow dynamics under different operating conditions, fluids, and channel lengths were collected and analyzed via a nonlinear characteristic parameter, Kolmogorov entropy (KE). Our results reveal that higher KE corresponds to unstable flow behavior, while lower KE refers to steady flow behavior; higher KE values appear at comparatively low or high gas flow rates, and most Taylor flow regime appeared at proper operating conditions with small KE. An equation derived based on the definition of KE is proposed to better understand KE characteristics, which include bubble break‐up impact and gas/liquid flow rate ratio. Predictions from the proposed analytical equation agree with experimental results, suggesting that the equation effectively identifies unstable flows and can be used to ensure stable and predictable multiphase flows in microchannels. {\textcopyright} 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 2378–2385, 2017},

We evaluate the performances of our approach on several benchmark tests, using different techniques to train the readout of the network, achieving superior predictive performance when using the proposed framework. Finally, we provide an insight on the effectiveness of the implemented mechanics through a visualization of the trajectory in the phase space and relying on the methodologies of nonlinear time-series analysis.

Forty patients (20 controls and 20 in the perturbation-based group) finished the whole experimental design. A random-perturbation exercise, which included variable and unpredictable disturbances, was implemented in the therapy of the perturbation-based group (13 weeks, two times per week and 1.5 h per session). The participants of the control group did not receive any specific training. Low-back pain, muscle strength, and neuromuscular control of spine stability were investigated before and after the therapy using the visual analog scale, maximal isometric and isokinetic contractions, nonlinear time series analysis, and by determining the stiffness and damping of the trunk after sudden perturbations. The perturbation-based therapy reduced patient's low-back pain (35{\%}), increased muscle strength (15-22{\%}), and trunk stiffness (13{\%}), while no significant changes were observed in the control group. It can be concluded that the proposed therapy has the potential to enhance trunk muscle capability as well as sensory information processing within the motor system during sudden loading and, as a consequence, improve the stabilization of the trunk.},

abstract = {The authors describe an example of application of a nonlinear time series analysis directed at identifying the presence of deterministic chaos in human gait kinematic data by means of the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE). A positive LLE value is interpreted as an indicator of local instability. The research was aimed at assessment of the influence of both walking speed and ground slope on the resilience of gait control to infinitesimally small perturbations that occur naturally during walking. The analysis of treadmill gait data was carried out twofold: 1) for the time series representing the following joint angles: hip flexion/extension, knee flexion/extension and dorsiflexion/plantarflexion of the ankle, and 2) for the time series representing rotations of foot, tibia and femur segments through Euler angles converted to a quaternion representation. A comparison between both approaches as well as a dependency between treadmill inclination and LLE values constitute the original aspects of this study. The LLE value was estimated threefold for every time series: as the short-term LLE for both the first step and the first stride and as the long-term LLE over a fixed interval between the fourth and the tenth stride. It was confirmed that all considered movements are characterized by positive LLE values which quantify a local instability. Moreover, a tendency to attenuate the perturbation consequences is evident in all variants of walking speed and treadmill slope.},

Manual coding of interactions is a time-consuming task, which is a limitation in many projects. This becomes especially demanding if a frame-by-frame categorisation of movement needs to be achieved. To overcome this, we present a computational approach for studying movement coupling in natural settings, which is a combination of a state-of-the-art automatic tracker, Tracking-Learning-Detection (TLD), and nonlinear time-series analysis, Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA). We investigated the use of TLD to extract and automatically classify movement of each partner from 21 video recordings of interactions, where 5.5-month-old infants and mothers engaged in free play in laboratory settings. As a proof of concept, we focused on those face-to-face episodes, where the mother animated an object in front of the infant, in order to measure the coordination between the infants' head movement and the mothers' hand movement. We also tested the feasibility of using such movement data to study behavioural coupling between partners with Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA). We demonstrate that movement can be extracted automatically from standard definition video recordings and used in subsequent CRQA to quantify the coupling between movement of the parent and the infant. Finally, we assess the quality of this coupling using an extension of CRQA called anisotropic CRQA and show asymmetric dynamics between the movement of the parent and the infant. When combined these methods allow automatic coding and classification of behaviours, which results in a more efficient manner of analysing movements than manual coding.},

The proposed methodology is to employ time series analysis methods as well as swarm and evolutionary algorithms in conjunction with well-known regression, fuzzy and neural network model structures to develop a simple but efficient and applicable model for solar irradiation forecasting. The employed experimental data was the hourly solar irradiation of Qazvin city in Iran for five years. At first, the solar irradiation data was normalized using the daily clear sky irradiation data which is an annually periodic time series. Then, the properties of normalized solar irradiation were characterized via time series analysis methods such as recurrence plots, autocorrelation and mutual information analysis. Based on these analyses, each year was divided into two seasons, the sunny and cloudy seasons which are noticeably different in dynamics. Next, a hybrid but simple model was developed to predict the solar irradiation in different seasons. For the sunny season, an optimized multivariate regression model was proposed; and for the cloudy season a bi-level model consisting of an optimized regression model and ANFIS was developed. The model parameters were tuned optimally by various evolutionary algorithms being GA, PSO, ABC, COA, and flower pollination algorithm (FPA). A Fourier-type model was also developed for modeling of the clear sky data. The results showed the out-performance of FPA method in tuning of the model parameters and convergence time. Besides, the performance of the proposed bi-level model was evaluated in comparison with some other model structures such as artificial neural networks, ANFIS networks, LSE-regression models, LS-support vector machines model, etc. The results showed that the proposed method performs considerably better than the other methods in forecasting the solar irradiation time series in both sunny and cloudy seasons.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Characterizing heart rate variability (HRV) in neonates has gained increased attention and is helpful in quantifying maturation and risk of sepsis in preterm infants. Raw data used to derive HRV in a clinical setting commonly contain noise from motion artifacts. Thoracic surface electromyography (sEMG) potentially allows for pre-emptive removal of motion artifacts and subsequent detection of interbeat interval (IBI) of heart rate to calculate HRV. We tested the feasibility of sEMG in preterm infants to exclude noisy raw data and to derive IBI for HRV analysis. We hypothesized that a stepwise quality control algorithm can identify motion artifacts which influence IBI values, their distribution in the time domain, and outcomes of nonlinear time series analysis. APPROACH: This is a prospective observational study in preterm infants {\textless}6 days of age. We used 100 sEMG measurements from 24 infants to develop a semi-automatic quality control algorithm including synchronized video recording, threshold-based sEMG envelope curve, optimized QRS-complex detection, and final targeted visual inspection of raw data. MAIN RESULTS: Analysis of HRV from sEMG data in preterm infants is feasible. A stepwise algorithm to exclude motion artifacts and improve QRS detection significantly influenced data quality (34{\%} of raw data excluded), distribution of IBI values in the time domain, and nonlinear time series analysis. The majority of unsuitable data (94{\%}) were excluded by automated steps of the algorithm. SIGNIFICANCE: Thoracic sEMG is a promising method to assess motion artifacts and calculate HRV in preterm neonates.},

abstract = {Policy makers need accurate forecasts about future values of exchange rates. This is due to the fact that exchange rate volatility is a useful measure of uncertainty about the economic environment of a country. This paper applies univariate nonlinear time series analysis to the daily (TZS/USD) exchange rate data spanning from January 4, 2009 to July 27, 2015 to examine the behavior of exchange rate in Tanzania. To capture the symmetry effect in exchange rate data, the paper applies both ARCH and GARCH models. Also, the paper employs exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model to capture the asymmetry in volatility clustering and the leverage effect in exchange rate. The paper reveals that exchange rate series exhibits the empirical regularities such as clustering volatility, nonstationarity, non-normality and serial correlation that justify the application of the ARCH methodology. The results also suggest that exchange rate behavior is generally influenced by previous information about exchange rate. This also implies that previous day's volatility in exchange rate can affect current volatility of exchange rate. In addition, the estimate for asymmetric volatility suggests that positive shocks imply a higher next period conditional variance than negative shocks of the same sign. The main policy implication of these results is that since exchange rate volatility (exchange-rate risk) may increase transaction costs and reduce the gains to international trade, knowledge of exchange rate volatility estimation and forecasting is important for asset pricing and risk management.},

Using direct numerical simulations and nonlinear time series analysis, we illustrate that the basic nature of flow reversals in convecting fluids can depend on the dimensionless parameters describing the system. Specifically, we find evidence of low-dimensional determinism in flow reversals occurring at zero Prandtl number, whereas we fail to find such signatures for reversals at infinite Prandtl number. Thus, even in a single system, as one varies the system parameters, one can encounter reversals that are fundamentally different in nature. Consequently, we conclude that a single general low-dimensional deterministic model cannot faithfully characterize flow reversals for every set of parameter values.},

The present study investigates the flow physics over an elastically mounted symmetric NACA 0012 airfoil with bending and torsion exibility in the low Reynolds number regime. The dynamical signature of the wake of the airfoil, with pitch and plunge dof, is investigated in a regime where structural and fluid-added mass are comparable (solid to uid added mass ratio, $\mu$ = 5) fitting the requirement of very light weight apping wing Micro Aerial Vehicles. The FSI solver is built by weakly coupling an incompressible Navier-Stokes solver with a 2-dof nonlinear structural model having cubic nonlinearity in the pitch stifiness. The present model is essentially a coupled nonlinear fluid-structure interaction (FSI) system which shows a rich bifurcation behaviour as the non-dimensional free stream velocity (U*) is increased as the control parameter. Due to the structural as well as fluid nonlinearity present in the system, successive Hopf bifurcations take place and the self-excited flapping response becomes quasi-periodic which in turn makes the flow-field quasi-periodic. The quasi-periodic flow dynamics has been explored in terms of the vortical signature of the wake followed by the phase averaged vorticity contours and correlation coefficient of the vorticity field. The nonlinear time series analysis of the aerodynamic loads has also been carried out to systematically establish the quasi-periodic flow dynamics.},

abstract = {Visibility graph (VG) and horizontal visibility graph (HVG) play a crucial role in modern complex network approaches to nonlinear time series analysis. However, depending on the underlying dynamic processes, it remains to characterize the exponents of presumably exponential degree distributions. It has been recently conjectured that there is a critical value of exponent $\lambda$c=ln3/2, which separates chaotic from correlated stochastic processes. Here, we systematically apply (H)VG analysis to time series from autoregressive (AR) models, which confirms the hypothesis that an increased correlation length results in larger values of $\lambda$ {\textgreater} $\lambda$c. On the other hand, we numerically find a regime of negatively correlated process increments where $\lambda$ {\textless} $\lambda$c, which is in contrast to this hypothesis. Furthermore, by constructing graphs based on re-sampled time series, we find that network measures show non-trivial dependencies on the autocorrelation functions of the processes. We propose to choose the decorrelation time as the maximal re-sampling delay for the algorithm. Our results are detailed for time series from AR(1) and AR(2) processes.},

abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of thermoacoustic interactions associated during vortex acoustic lock-on in the phase space. Experiments are performed in a premixed, gas fueled bluff body stabilized combustor. The geometry of the burner is designed such that vortex shedding from the bluff body is strong. Air flow rate is varied in a quasi-steady manner, for a given fuel flow rate. It is observed that at low air flow rates, the dominant frequency increases linearly with the air flow rate. The obtained Strouhal number matches with the mode associated with vortex shedding from the bluff body. On the other hand, for higher flow rates the dominant frequency remains almost constant with the air flow rate, indicating the acoustic mode of the combustor. It is also found that at these flow rates, vortex shedding process locks on to the frequency of the acoustic mode. Tools from nonlinear time series analysis are applied to study this transition. The attractor is reconstructed in the phase space and its properties are monitored.},

abstract = {Several efforts have been made to study gait stability using measures derived from nonlinear time-series analysis. The maximum finite time Lyapunov exponent (??max) quantifies how a system responds to an infinitesimally small perturbation. Recent studies suggested that slow walking leads to lower ??max values, and thus is more stable than fast walking, but these studies suffer from methodological limitations. We studied the effects of walking speed on the amount of kinematic variability and stability in human walking. Trunk motions of 15 healthy volunteers were recorded in 3D during 2 min of treadmill walking at different speeds. From those time series, maximum Lyapunov exponents, indicating short-term and long-term divergence (??S-stride and ??L-stride), and mean standard deviation (MeanSD) were calculated. ??S-stride showed a linear decrease with increasing speed for forward-backward (AP) movements and quadratic effects (inverted U-shaped) for medio-lateral (ML) and up-down (VT) movements. ??L-stride showed a quadratic effect (inverted U-shaped) of walking speed for AP movements, a linear decrease for ML movements, and a linear increase for VT movements. Moreover, positive correlations between ??S and MeanSD were found for all directions, while ??L-stride and MeanSD were correlated negatively in the AP direction. The different effects of walking speed on ??S-stride and ??L-stride for the different planes suggest that slow walking is not necessarily more stable than fast walking. The absence of a consistent pattern of correlations between ??L-stride and MeanSD over the three directions suggests that variability and stability reflect, at least to a degree, different properties of the dynamics of walking. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The reaction terms of this system are of non constant sign, thus components of the solution are not bounded apriori, and functional means to derive apriori bounds will fail. We prove global existence of solutions, via construction of an appropriate lyapunov functional. Furthermore due to the sign changing nonlinearities, the asymptotic sign condition is also not satisfied, causing further difficulties in proving the existence of global attractor. These difficulties are circumvented via the use of the lyapunov functional constructed along with the use of the uniform gronwall lemma. We are able to prove the existence of an attractor for the system, improving previous results in the literature.The Hausdorff and fractal dimensions of the attractor are also shown to be finite.In particular we derive a lower bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the global attractor. We use numerical simulations,as well as numerical attractor reconstruction methods via nonlinear time series analysis, to validate our results.},

A GPDM is a latent variable model. It comprises a low-dimensional latent space with associated dynamics, and a map from the latent space to an observation space. We marginalize out the model parameters in closed-form, using Gaussian process priors for both the dynamics and the observation mappings. This results in a non-parametric model for dynamical systems that accounts for uncertainty in the model. We demonstrate the approach, and compare four learning algorithms on human motion capture data in which each pose is 50-dimensional.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Author(s). In a previous paper, the authors studied the limits of probabilistic prediction in nonlinear time series analysis in a perfect model scenario, i.e., in the ideal case that the uncertainty of an otherwise deterministic model is due to only the finite precision of the observations. The model consisted of the symbolic dynamics of a measure-preserving transformation with respect to a finite partition of the state space, and the quality of the predictions was measured by the so-called ignorance score, which is a conditional entropy. In practice, though, partitions are dispensed with by considering numerical and experimental data to be continuous, which prompts us to trade off in this paper the Shannon entropy for the differential entropy. Despite technical differences, we show that the core of the previous results also hold in this extended scenario for sufficiently high precision. The corresponding imperfect model scenario will be revisited too because it is relevant for the applications. The theoretical part and its application to probabilistic forecasting are illustrated with numerical simulations and a new prediction algorithm.},

Phase recurrence analysis and long-range persistence are the two dynamical structures of the underlying processes for the given natural phenomenon. Linear and nonlinear time series analysis approaches (cross-correlation analysis, cross-recurrence plot, wavelet coherent transform, and Hurst analysis) are combined to investigate the relative phase interconnection and long-range correlation between solar activity and geomagnetic activity for the time interval from 1932 January to 2017 January. The following prominent results are found: (1) geomagnetic activity lags behind sunspot numbers with a phase shift of 21 months, and they have a high level of asynchronous behavior; (2) their relative phase interconnections are in phase for the periodic scales during 8-16 years, but have a mixing behavior for the periodic belts below 8 years; (3) both sunspot numbers and geomagnetic activity can not be regarded as a stochastic phenomenon because their dynamical behaviors display a long-term correlation and a fractal nature. We believe that the presented conclusions could provide further information on understanding the dynamical coupling of solar dynamo process with geomagnetic activity variation, and the crucial role of solar and geomagnetic activity in the long-term climate change.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for analysing the structural properties of time series from complex systems. Starting from the concept of recurrences in phase space, the recurrence matrix of a time series is interpreted as the adjacency matrix of an associated complex network, which links different points in time if the considered states are closely neighboured in phase space. In comparison with similar network-based techniques the new approach has important conceptual advantages, and can be considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex networks that also includes other existing methods as special cases. It has been demonstrated here that there are fundamental relationships between many topological properties of recurrence networks and different nontrivial statistical properties of the phase space density of the underlying dynamical system. Hence, this novel interpretation of the recurrence matrix yields new quantitative characteristics (such as average path length, clustering coefficient, or centrality measures of the recurrence network) related to the dynamical complexity of a time series, most of which are not yet provided by other existing methods of nonlinear time series analysis.},

abstract = {Legume plants form beneficial symbiotic interactions with nitrogen fixing bacteria (called rhizobia), with the rhizobia being accommodated in unique structures on the roots of the host plant. The legume/rhizobial symbiosis is responsible for a significant proportion of the global biologically available nitrogen. The initiation of this symbiosis is governed by a characteristic calcium oscillation within the plant root hair cells and this signal is activated by the rhizobia. Recent analyses on calcium time series data have suggested that stochastic effects have a large role to play in defining the nature of the oscillations. The use of multiple nonlinear time series techniques, however, suggests an alternative interpretation, namely deterministic chaos. We provide an extensive, nonlinear time series analysis on the nature of this calcium oscillation response. We build up evidence through a series of techniques that test for determinism, quantify linear and nonlinear components, and measure the local divergence of the system. Chaos is common in nature and it seems plausible that properties of chaotic dynamics might be exploited by biological systems to control processes within the cell. Systems possessing chaotic control mechanisms are more robust in the sense that the enhanced flexibility allows more rapid response to environmental changes with less energetic costs. The desired behaviour could be most efficiently targeted in this manner, supporting some intriguing speculations about nonlinear mechanisms in biological signaling.},

While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems. The overall aim of this report is to provide the readers with the knowledge how the complex network approaches can be applied to their own field of real-world time series analysis.},

The variation of wavelet entropy is approved to be associated with the periodicity variation of pressure signals.

The limit-cycle oscillation is exhibited in the phase space diagram with a very low flow rate, here 25 g/s. The mean wavelet entropy of pressure-time series can be a quantitative index of different combustion modes occurring in the combustor.

In contrast to conventional linear tools based on the Fourier transform, these nonlinear tools can enable unambiguous identification of different dynamical states, such as period-k states, quasiperiodicity and chaos.

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to investigate the athletic-based specificity of muscle strength and neuromuscular control of spine stability in chronic non-specific low-back pain. Thirty elite athletes and 29 age-matched non-athletes with (15 athletes and 15 non-athletes) and without low-back pain (15 athletes and 14 non-athletes) participated in the study. Muscle strength was measured during maximal isometric trunk flexion and trunk extension contractions. The neuromuscular control of spine stability was analyzed by determining trunk stiffness, trunk damping, and onset times of the lumbar and thoracic erector spinae muscles after sudden perturbations (quick release experiments) as well as maximum Lyapunov exponents (local dynamic stability) using nonlinear time series analysis of repetitive lifting movements. Low back pain was assessed using the visual analog scale. We found lower maximal trunk extension moments (p=0.03), higher trunk damping (p=0.018) and shorter onset times (p=0.03) of the investigated trunk muscles in low-back pain patients in both athletes and non-athletes. Trunk stiffness and the local dynamic stability did not show any differences (p=0.136 and p=0.375 respectively) between low-back pain patients and healthy controls in both groups. It can be concluded that, despite the high-level of training in athletes, both athletes and non-athletes with low-back pain showed the same deconditioning of the lumbar extensor muscles and developed similar strategies to ensure spine stability after sudden perturbations to protect the spine from pain and damage. The findings highlight that specific training interventions for the trunk muscles are not only crucial for individuals of the general population, but also for well-trained athletes.},

The present study investigates the flow physics over an elastically mounted symmetric NACA 0012 airfoil with bending and torsion exibility in the low Reynolds number regime. The dynamical signature of the wake of the airfoil, with pitch and plunge dof, is investigated in a regime where structural and fluid-added mass are comparable (solid to uid added mass ratio, $\mu$ = 5) fitting the requirement of very light weight apping wing Micro Aerial Vehicles. The FSI solver is built by weakly coupling an incompressible Navier-Stokes solver with a 2-dof nonlinear structural model having cubic nonlinearity in the pitch stifiness. The present model is essentially a coupled nonlinear fluid-structure interaction (FSI) system which shows a rich bifurcation behaviour as the non-dimensional free stream velocity (U*) is increased as the control parameter. Due to the structural as well as fluid nonlinearity present in the system, successive Hopf bifurcations take place and the self-excited flapping response becomes quasi-periodic which in turn makes the flow-field quasi-periodic. The quasi-periodic flow dynamics has been explored in terms of the vortical signature of the wake followed by the phase averaged vorticity contours and correlation coefficient of the vorticity field. The nonlinear time series analysis of the aerodynamic loads has also been carried out to systematically establish the quasi-periodic flow dynamics.},

abstract = {Identifying behavioural basis of competitive relationship is essential to understand outcome of interspecific competition. However, it remains difficult to investigate demographic effect of competitive behaviour, because various kinds of behaviours may co-occur in the competition and make the dynamics far complicated in nonlinear ways. We report that the behavioural basis of interspecific interaction can be identified, by focusing on the timescale difference from the occurrence of each behaviour to the appearance of its demographic effect. Between two bean beetles, Callosobruchus chinensis and C. maculatus, major interspecific interactions are resource competition (RC) at the larval stage and reproductive interference (RI) at the adult stage. RC has longer time lag than RI, because effect of RC appears in the adult number of the next generation through larval competition while effect of RI appears instantaneously in the adult number through early death of females. If we detect two effects with different time lags from the competition dynamics, an effect with intergenerational time lag and with no time lag would be considered as RC and RI, respectively. We applied empirical dynamic modelling approach, which is a nonlinear time series analysis for detecting causal interactions and the strength, to two published datasets of experimental competition between those beetles. Results showed the significant causality from the winner species to the loser one in both experiments, but the causality time lag differed between experiments: the causality had no time lag in the C. chinensis-win data, while intergenerational time lag in C. maculatus-win data. Furthermore, detection of the causality with intergenerational time lag from C. maculatus to C. chinensis in both experiments suggests interplay of constant RC and variable RI which can reverse the outcome. This study is the first successful case study that links behavioural-level interactions to demographic-level effects in interspecific competition. This article is protected by copyright.

Thirty elite athletes and 29 age-matched non-athletes with (15 athletes and 15 non-athletes) and without low-back pain (15 athletes and 14 non-athletes) participated in the study. Muscle strength was measured during maximal isometric trunk flexion and trunk extension contractions. The neuromuscular control of spine stability was analyzed by determining trunk stiffness, trunk damping, and onset times of the lumbar and thoracic erector spinae muscles after sudden perturbations (quick release experiments) as well as maximum Lyapunov exponents (local dynamic stability) using nonlinear time series analysis of repetitive lifting movements. Low back pain was assessed using the visual analog scale. We found lower maximal trunk extension moments (p=0.03), higher trunk damping (p=0.018) and shorter onset times (p=0.03) of the investigated trunk muscles in low-back pain patients in both athletes and non-athletes. Trunk stiffness and the local dynamic stability did not show any differences (p=0.136 and p=0.375 respectively) between low-back pain patients and healthy controls in both groups.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Most naturally-occurring physical phenomena are examples of nonlinear dynamic systems, the functioning of which attracts many researchers seeking to unveil their nature. The research presented in this paper is aimed at exploring eye movement dynamic features in terms of the existence of chaotic nature. Nonlinear time series analysis methods were used for this purpose. Two time series features were studied: fractal dimension and entropy, by utilising the embedding theory. The methods were applied to the data collected during the experiment with "jumping point" stimulus. Eye movements were registered by means of the Jazz-novo eye tracker. One thousand three hundred and ninety two (1392) time series were defined, based on the horizontal velocity of eye movements registered during imposed, prolonged fixations. In order to conduct detailed analysis of the signal and identify differences contributing to the observed patterns of behaviour in time scale, fractal dimension and entropy were evaluated in various time series intervals. The influence of the noise contained in the data and the impact of the utilized filter on the obtained results were also studied. The low pass filter was used for the purpose of noise reduction with a 50 Hz cut-off frequency, estimated by means of the Fourier transform and all concerned methods were applied to time series before and after noise reduction. These studies provided some premises, which allow perceiving eye movements as observed chaotic data: characteristic of a space-time separation plot, low and non-integer time series dimension, and the time series entropy characteristic for chaotic systems.},

Here we relate the growth of electrical trees with the correlation dimension of the reconstructed dynamic object obtained from the nonlinear time series of the partial discharges from the tree propagation, and with the box-counting fractal dimension of the resulting 3D structure of the trees. The growth of trees at 8, 10 and 12 kV has been analyzed; different PD dynamics were found, depending on both the voltage and the stage of growth. A lower fractal dimension is shown to be related to a lower correlation dimension. The results show that nonlinear time series analysis can be an alternative method of analyzing tree growth and associated partial discharges.},

abstract = {This study showed how interpersonal coordination between a psychotherapist and client changes during a psychological counseling session and how it reflects it. We aimed to evaluate psychological counseling sessions and understand psychotherapists' embodied skills. Recently, it is considered that bodily coordination between a therapist and a client as well as psychotherapists' embodied skills is important. We conducted an exploratory case study with quantitative analysis and a qualitative analysis. One female student and one female psychotherapist participated in our experiment. The student had a counseling session for 50 minutes in a session, which was video recorded. After quantifying both participants' bodily activities by video image processing, the data were analyzed using nonlinear time series analysis in terms of the degree of coordination and the direction of influence. The data were also analyzed qualitatively by multiple researchers observing the video and by interviewing the psychotherapist. We identified the critical points of the session when the state of the client's mind and the relationship between the therapist and client qualitatively changed. The results of qualitative and quantitative analyses were then compared. The results of the quantitative analysis showed that the degree of bodily coordination between the client and therapist was relatively high in three characteristic scenes: 1) building rapport, 2) clinical intervention, and 3) summarizing and closing the session. These results suggest that bodily coordination can highlight clinically important scenes. Moreover, the direction of influence also changed drastically in the clinical intervention scene. This case study suggests that interpersonal coordination between the client and therapist in a counseling session can partly reflect the quality of counseling (e.g. client-therapist relationship, clinical intervention).},

Furthemore, in the areas of space science which deals with a large variety of data, the practical consistence between workload, workflow and cloud computing is crucial. Here, such consistence is provided by an innovative e-Science framework project named Sentinel which is based on a NoSQL data base (MongoDB) and a containerization platform (Docker). This web framework supports researchers for time series analysis in a cloud environment where they can easily access, parameterize, initialize and monitor their applications. As a case study in the Brazilian Space Weather Program, we consider the intensive analysis of time series from a complex information system for solar activity monitoring and forecasting. As a prototype for implementing the framework, the DFA (detrended fluctuation analysis) technique was used as a nonlinear spectrum analyzer applied to the solar irradiance measurements from 1978 to 2012. Moreover, new applications can be added and managed by researchers on the portal easily to complement their data analysis purposes.},

abstract = {Owing to an ageing population, the impact of unhealthy lifestyle, or simply congenital or gender specific issues (dysplasia), degenerative bone and joint disease (osteoarthritis) at the hip pose an increasing problem in many countries. Osteoarthritis is painful and causes mobility restrictions; amelioration is often only achieved by replacing the complete hip joint in a total hip arthroplasty (THA). Despite significant orthopaedic progress related to THA, the success of the surgical process relies heavily on the judgement, experience, skills and techniques used of the surgeon. One common way of implanting the stem into the femur is press fitting uncemented stem designs into a prepared cavity. By using a range of compaction broaches, which are impacted into the femur, the cavity for the implant is formed. However, the surgeon decides whether to change the size of the broach, how hard and fast it is impacted or when to stop the excavation process, merely based on acoustic, haptic or visual cues which are subjective. It is known that non-ideal cavity preparations increase the risk of peri-prosthetic fractures especially in elderly people. This study reports on a simulated hip replacement surgery on a cadaver and the analysis of impaction forces and the microphone signals during compaction. The recorded transient signals of impaction forces and acoustic pressures (≈ 80 µs–2 ms) are statistically analysed for their trend, which shows increasing heteroscedasticity in the force-pressure relationship between broach sizes. TIKHONOV regularisation, as inverse deconvolution technique, is applied to calculate the acoustic transfer functions from the acoustic responses and their mechanical impacts. The extracted spectra highlight that system characteristics altered during the cavity preparation process: in the high-frequency range the number of resonances increased with impacts and broach size. By applying nonlinear time series analysis the system dynamics increase in complexity and demand for a larger minimum embedding dimension. The growing number of resonances with similar level of the transfer function indicates a higher propensity to dissipate energy as sound; the change in embedding dimension indicates a decrease in linearity. The spectral changes as well as the embedding dimension changes indicate either an improved coupling between the bone and the broach or the onset of micro-fractures caused by growing stress levels within the bone.},

In particular, I focus on a class of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) called the Radial Basis Functions (RBF). To assess the valid-ity of the RBF approach in the macroeconomic time series analysis, I conduct a Monte Carlo experiment using the data generated from a nonlinear New Key-nesian (NK) model. I find that the RBF estimator can uncover the structure of the nonlinear NK model from the simulated data whose length is as small as 300 periods. Finally, I apply the RBF estimator to the quarterly US data and show that the response of the macroeconomic variables to a positive supply shock exhibits a substantial time variation. In particular, the positive supply shocks are found to have significantly weaker expansionary e↵ects during the zero lower bound periods as well as periods between 2003 and 2004. The find-ing is consistent with a basic NK model, which predicts that the higher real interest rate due to the monetary policy inaction weakens the e↵ects of supply shocks.},

abstract = {Economists conventionally attribute observed volatility in economic time series data to exogenous random shocks that agitate otherwise stable real-world markets and, consequently, model volatility with a variety of linear–stochastic and probabilistic methods. However, some economists have recognized another possible explanation for volatility: markets may be intrinsically unstable, and we might be able to model attending volatility parsimoniously with low-dimensional, nonlinear, deterministic dynamic models without resorting to stochastic inputs. Whether observed volatility is generated by inherently stable or unstable markets has serious policy implications. Will laissez-faire policies suffice to dampen volatility because markets are self-correcting, or are interventionist policies required? This chapter introduces nonlinear time series analysis (NLTS) – a collection of methods developed in mathematical physics to diagnose the source of real-world volatility from observed time series data. Depending on data quality, economists can potentially use NLTS to reconstruct phase-space market dynamics and extract equations of motion from a single price series.},

This paper presents a time-division cerebellar model articulation controller (TDCMAC) network using a modified biogeography-based optimization (modified BBO) learning algorithm for nonlinear time series and measurement data prediction. The TDCMAC method is a time windowing strategy constructed using the CMAC network. BBO algorithm is designed related to the geographical distribution of species over time and space. This study presents two modified migration functions of the essential BBO, i.e. quadratic migration BBO (QBBO) and sinusoidal migration BBO (SBBO) methods, to improve convergence rate and quality of solution. Five nonlinear time series, including Mackey-glass, Lorenz, Rossler, Limber Pine, and Ponderosa Pine data series, are employed to investigate the proposed predictor. The TDCMAC networks using QBBO and SBBO learning algorithms are compared with the gradient descent (GD) method and other existing heuristic learning methods, including particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and conventional BBO methods, to verify the estimation performance of the proposed method. The performances are evaluated through an extensive simulation by computing the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and average relative variance (ARV) metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed predictor indeed achieve more accurate performances and faster learning speed for time series prediction applications.},

It is often solved with model construction in a controllable computational environment. In spite of that, the throughput of in-silico simulation-based observations become similarly intractable for thorough analysis. This is especially the case in molecular biology, which served as a subject for this study. In this project, we aimed to test some approaches developed to deal with the curse of dimensionality. Among these we found dimension reduction techniques especially appealing. They can be used to identify irrelevant variability and help to understand critical processes underlying high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we subjected our data sets to nonlinear time series analysis, as those are well established methods for results comparison. To investigate the usefulness of dimension reduction methods, we decided to base our study on a concrete sample set. The example was taken from the domain of systems biology concerning dynamic evolution of sub-cellular signaling. Particularly, the dataset relates to the yeast pheromone pathway and is studied in-silico with a stochastic model. The model reconstructs signal propagation stimulated by a mating pheromone. In the paper, we elaborate on the reason of multidimensional analysis problem in the context of molecular signaling, and next, we introduce the model of choice, simulation details and obtained time series dynamics. A description of used methods followed by a discussion of results and their biological interpretation finalize the paper.},
