abstract = {The absolute value of the mean-corrected excess return is used in this paper to measure the volatility of stock returns. We apply various nonlinearity tests available in the literature to show that such volatility series are strongly nonlinear. We then explore the use of threshold autoregressive (TAR) models in describing monthly volatility series. The models built suggest that the volatility series exhibit significant lower-order serial correlations when the volatility is large, indicating certain volatility clustering in stock returns. Out-of-sample forecasts are used to compare the TAR models with linear ARMA models and nonlinear GARCH and EGARCH models. Based on mean squared error and average absolute deviation, the comparisons show that (a) the TAR models consistently outperform the linear ARMA models in multi-step ahead forecasts for large stocks, (b) the TAR models provide better forecasts than the GARCH and EGARCH models also for the volatilities of large stock returns, and (c) the EGARCH model gives the best long-horizon volatility forecasts for small stock returns.},

abstract = {The classical approach towards time series analysis of fluctuating phenomena is based on linear stochastic processes in the basin of attraction of globally stable equilibria (ARMA models). However, there are deductive reasons derived from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics that many self-generated population fluctuations should be interpreted as stochastic processes influenced by nonequilibrium attractors of nonlinear dynamical systems. The incidence pattern of measles epidemics in New York City is used to demonstrate that highly nonlinear autoregressive models can serve as a new semi-phenomenological level of description for complex self-generated fluctuations in biological or ecological systems. The nature of the unpredictability of the incidence pattern of measles is characterized by a subtle interaction between a chaotic nonlinear determinism and stochastic fluctuations. The sensitive dependence on initial conditions, characteristic for chaos, is not limited to chaotic attractors but can also occur on so-called chaotic transients. The dynamics of recurrent outbreaks of measles in New York City turns out to be close to a so-called boundary crisis which converts a stable chaotic attractor to metastable chaotic transients leading finally to a period-3 attractor. However, the demographic noise destabilizes the periodic orbit as well, and creates a situation of intermittent jumps between episodic periodicities and longer chaotic transients. A simple autoregressive model is used to achieve a plausible geometric understanding of the noise-induced intermittency switching between episodic periodicity and transient chaos. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been an increasing number of papers in the literature, applying the methods and techniques of Nonlinear Dynamics to the time series of electrical activity in normal electrocardiograms (ECGs) of various human subjects. Most of these studies are based primarily on correlation dimension estimates, and conclude that the dynamics of the ECG signal is deterministic and occurs on a chaotic attractor, whose dimension can distinguish between healthy and severely malfunctioning cases. In this paper, we first demonstrate that correlation dimension calculations must be used with care, as they do not always yield reliable estimates of the attractor's "dimension." We then carry out a number of additional tests (time differencing, smoothing, principal component analysis, surrogate data analysis, etc.) on the ECGs of three "normal" subjects and three "heavy smokers" at rest and after mild exercising, whose cardiac rhythms look very similar. Our main conclusion is that no major dynamical differences are evident in these signals. A preliminary estimate of three to four basic variables governing the dynamics (based on correlation dimension calculations) is updated to five to six, when temporal correlations between points are removed. Finally, in almost all cases, the transition between resting and mild exercising seems to imply a small increase in the complexity of cardiac dynamics. (c) 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We report on the analysis of experiments on a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser with an intracavity frequency-doubling crystal. Three modes of the laser were excited in differing polarization configurations. The total intensity of infrared light was observed and then analyzed using methods of nonlinear-time-series analysis. We present clear evidence using global false nearest neighbors that when all polarizations are parallel, the intensity is chaotic with two positive Lyapunov exponents and the system can be embedded in dimension 7. The noise level in this operating condition, which we call type I chaos, is small. When one of the polarizations is perpendicular to the others, the intensity is again chaotic with positive Lyapunov exponents, but there is substantial noise in the signal of high dimensional origin, and no finite embedding dimension appears possible. We call this type II chaos. We suggest that the origin of this phenomenon is the intrinsic quantum noise associated with the generation of green light, which is 25 times more intense in the type II operating configuration than in the first. In past experiments with this system we have found that the type I chaos can be controlled to unstable periodic orbits while type II cannot. In each type of chaotic laser operation we use local false nearest neighbors to demonstrate that the local dimension of the dynamics is 7. This means seven differential equations can capture the full dynamics of these regimes of the laser. We evaluate local and global false nearest neighbors to support our conclusions and determine the Lyapunov spectrum of each type of chaotic behavior. The predictability of type II chaos is shown to be much less than that of type I, and we make local polynomial models in reconstructed-state space to demonstrate that we can predict rather well for type I chaos. Finally we suggest a fairly standard model for the interaction of the infrared light with the nonlinear frequency doubling medium and with a two-level of the active medium. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

Ground sotol head was subjected to enzymatic extraction at various enzyme activities (0.0–175.73 U/mL) and fresh sotol concentrations (4.47–28.52 g/100 mL) at 30 °C for 8 h, using the response surface methodology to optimize the fructan extraction. Reducing sugars (RS), total carbohydrates (TC), fructan content (FRU), fructan profile, and the average degree of polymerization (DPn) were evaluated. Additionally, RS release kinetics and the enzyme rate constant (V0) were calculated. Enzyme concentration and substrate significantly affected (P {\textless} 0.05) the RS extraction, FRU, and V0, while DPn was only affected (P {\textless} 0.05) by the substrate concentration. Higher RS contents were obtained at lower substrate concentrations for {\textgreater} 87.87 U/mL enzyme, and fructan extraction was maximal (39.08 g/100 g d.m.) at 83.04 U/mL enzyme and 6.70 g/100 mL substrate. V0 and RS content exhibited similar trends. DPn increased as substrate concentration decreased. Optimal enzymatic liquefaction conditions were 11.6–45.6 U/mL enzyme and 9.15–12.6 g/100 mL sotol, yielding elevated fructan (38.58 g/100 g d.m.), DPn of 8–10, and low fructose (1.8 g/100 g d.m.) and glucose (2.2 g/100 g d.m.) contents. These results demonstrate the feasibility of enzymatic liquefaction for extracting fructans from sotol heads without modifying the molecular structure.},

abstract = {Characterizing locomotor dynamics is essential for understanding the neuromuscular control of locomotion. In particular, quantifying dynamic stability during walking is important for assessing people who have a greater risk of falling. However, traditional biomechanical methods of defining stability have not quantified the resistance of the neuromuscular system to perturbations, suggesting that more precise definitions are required. For the present study, average maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponents were estimated to quantify the local dynamic stability of human walking kinematics. Local scaling exponents, defined as the local slopes of the correlation sum curves, were also calculated to quantify the local scaling structure of each embedded time series. Comparisons were made between overground and motorized treadmill walking in young healthy subjects and between diabetic neuropathic (NP) patients and healthy controls (CO) during overground walking. A modification of the method of surrogate data was developed to examine the stochastic nature of the fluctuations overlying the nominally periodic patterns in these data sets. Results demonstrated that having subjects walk on a motorized treadmill artificially stabilized their natural locomotor kinematics by small but statistically significant amounts. Furthermore, a paradox previously present in the biomechanical literature that resulted from mistakenly equating variability with dynamic stability was resolved. By slowing their self-selected walking speeds, NP patients adopted more locally stable gait patterns, even though they simultaneously exhibited greater kinematic variability than CO subjects. Additionally, the loss of peripheral sensation in NP patients was associated with statistically significant differences in the local scaling structure of their walking kinematics at those length scales where it was anticipated that sensory feedback would play the greatest role. Lastly, stride-to-stride fluctuations in the walking patterns of all three subject groups were clearly distinguishable from linearly autocorrelated Gaussian noise. As a collateral benefit of the methodological approach taken in this study, some of the first steps at characterizing the underlying structure of human locomotor dynamics have been taken. Implications for understanding the neuromuscular control of locomotion are discussed. (c) 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

In the absence of an independent way to determine anesthesia depth, the standard was derived from measured blood plasma concentrations of the anesthetic via a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for the estimated effective brain concentration of sevoflurane. In most patients, the highest correlation is observed for the nonlinear correlation index D*. In contrast to spectral measures, D* is found to decrease monotonically with increasing (estimated) depth of anesthesia, even when a "burst-suppression" pattern occurs in the EEG.

We present several examples (heart, nephrons, epileptic seizures) where evidence for the latter has been found. We then start the more technical part by discussing time delay embeddings and the choices of parameters for them. After that we shall discuss noise reduction algorithms and algorithms for signal separation based on the geometry of embeddings. In particular we shall present the extraction of fetal heart beat from a univariate ECG signal. We then discuss classical invariants (metric entropy, attractor dimension, Lyapunov exponents) and argue why using them as indicators for chaotic determinism is not very useful. The same should be true also for alternatives like false nearest neighbors or forecasting errors. In contrast we shall argue that strict determinism is not needed for the arsenal of nonlinear time series analysis to be useful. We shall argue that the above observables can indeed be very useful in clinical applications. As an illustration we shall discuss evidence that epileptic seizures can be predicted and epileptic foci can be localized by using. dimension-like observables. Typical features of deterministic chaos are the existence of unstable periodic orbits and the possibility to control such systems by arbitrarily small perturbances. We shall comment on claims that such periodic orbits have been found in biomedical systems, and we shall discuss whether chaos control could eventually be used in intelligent heart pacemakers. Finally, we shall discuss various methods to study interdependencies between different time series. These include cross correlation and coherence, mutual information, phase synchronization, and other interdependence measures. We shall discuss their usefulness in EEG analysis, in particular for epilepsy patients. Among these measures, of particular interest are asymmetric measures because they could, independent of time delays, indicate causal connections. Again this is illustrated with epileptic EEGs.},

abstract = {Finger photoplethismography (PPG) signals were submitted to nonlinear time series analysis. The applied analytical techniques were: (i) High degree polynomial fitting for baseline estimation; (ii) FFT analysis for estimating power spectra; (iii) fractal dimension estimation via the Higuchi's time-domain method, and (iv) kernel nonparametric estimation for reconstructing noise free-attractors and also for estimating signal's stochastic components. The PPG signal could be separated into the following 3 components: 1) A baseline, nonlinear-time-dependent nonstationary nonstationarity of the PPG signal. 2) A nonlinear, time invariant deterministic limit-cycle component, which corresponds to the generation of pulsatile waves, the most relevant point of the PPG signal in clinical studies. 3) A stochastic component, which is at least partially fractal. This component bears less than 5{\%} of the variance of the baseline-corrected signal. The sum of the baseline (1) plus the stochastic (3) components accounts for the fractal-like properties of the original PPG signal. We consider that the separation of the PPG signal into three distinguishable components opens the possibility purposes.},

The recurrence plots, spatiotemporal entropy and the result of the surrogate data test show the deterministic nature of the fluctuations, rejecting the hypothesis that H belong to the family of linear stochastic signals. The low dimensional character of the dynamics is evident from the estimated value of the correlation dimension and the fraction of false neighbours calculated for various embedding dimensions. The exponential decay of the power spectrum and the positive Lyapunov exponent indicate chaotic behaviour of the underlying dynamics of H. This is also supported by the results of the comparison of the chaotic characteristics of the time series of H with the pseudo-chaotic characteristics of coloured noise time series. We have also shown that the error involved in the short-term prediction of successive values of H, using a simple but robust, zero-order nonlinear prediction method, increases exponentially. It has also been suggested that there exists the possibility of characterizing the geomagnetic fluctuations in terms of the invariants in chaos theory, such as Lyapunov exponents and correlation dimension. The results of the analysis could also have implications in the development of a suitable model for the daily fluctuations of geomagnetic horizontal intensity.},

abstract = {Higher variability in rainfall and river discharge could be of major importance in landslide generation in the north-western Argentine Andes. Annual layered (varved) deposits of a landslide dammed lake in the Santa Maria Basin (26 deg S, 66 deg W) with an age of 30,000 14C years provide an archive of precipitation variability during this time. The comparison of these data with present-day rainfall observations tests the hypothesis that increased rainfall variability played a major role in landslide generation. A potential cause of such variability is the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The causal link between ENSO and local rainfall is quantified by using a new method of nonlinear data analysis, the quantitative analysis of cross recurrence plots (CRP). This method seeks similarities in the dynamics of two different processes, such as an ocean-atmosphere oscillation and local rainfall. Our analysis reveals significant similarities in the statistics of both modern and palaeo-precipitation data. The similarities in the data suggest that an ENSO-like influence on local rainfall was present at around 30,000 14C years ago. Increased rainfall, which was inferred from a lake balance modeling in a previous study, together with ENSO-like cyclicities could help to explain the clustering of landslides at around 30,000 14C years ago.},

The main argument in this article is that Collins and De Luca's approach is not adapted to the analysis of bounded time series and leads to statistical artifacts such as underestimation of the diffusion process for long-term intervals. The open- and closed-loop model developed by Collins and De Luca is a direct consequence of those statistical problems. Applying more classical methods, such as rescaled range analysis or detrended fluctuation analysis, the authors show that center-of-pressure trajectories can be modeled as continuous, antipersistent fractional Brownian motion. More specifically, those trajectories behave like 1/f noise, a ubiquitous feature in adaptive biological systems.},

Time series measurements collected over a pine forest, a hardwood forest, a grass-covered forest clearing, and a bare soil, desert surface were used for this purpose. The results from applying all three nonlinear time series measures suggest that w in the CSL is more organized than that in the ASL, and that as the flows in both layers evolve from near-neutral to near-convective conditions, the level of organization increases. Furthermore, we found that the degree of organization in w associated with changes in ? is more significant than the transition from CSL to ASL.},

Specifically, the mu c-Si film anatomy consists of an interface layer at the substrate/mu c-Si bulk layer, a bulk mu c-Si layer, and a surface porous layer. All these layers have their own microstructures, which need to be highlighted, since it is this overall anatomy which determines the optical properties of mu c-Si films. The ability of SE to discriminate the complex microstructure of mu c-Si thin films is emphasized also by the comparison with the x-ray diffraction data which cannot provide unambiguous information regarding the distribution of the crystalline and the amorphous phases along the mu c-Si film thickness. Through the description of the mu c-Si film anatomy, information on the effect of the growth precursors (SiF4 or SiH4) and of the substrate (c-Si or Corning glass) on the growth dynamics can be obtained.

abstract = {Traditional linear analysis in the time series has been routinely used but did not seem to successfully give insight into the characteristic and mechanism of time series because these methods are limited by the requirement of stationarity of the time series and normality and independence of the residuals. A new data processing technique, known as data mining, can overcome these problems and effectively draw off the hidden information in these large time series data sets. A new framework for analyzing time series data called Time Series Data Mining (TSDM) motivated us to adapt and innovate data mining concepts, dynamical approaches in chaos theory, and optimization techniques to the areas of time series analysis.    The main objective of this research is to provide new data mining concepts and a new set of methods, based on time series analysis, chaos theory and optimization techniques, that are able to characterize, draw inferences, and reveal hidden temporal patterns that are predictive characteristics of time series events. These tools can be used to develop a new technique for the prediction of the time series arising in real world problems, as well as to conduct advanced studies on the subject.    In this dissertation, analysis based on chaos theory and theory of nonlinear dynamics has been applied to time series data to identify complex (nonperiodic, nonlinear, irregular, and chaotic) characteristics. Several alternative optimization methods for reconstructing parameter spaces of the dynamcal systems and identifying predictive temporal patterns in the system are employed. Specifically, these problems can be formulated as multi-quadratic programming (MCP) problems. To solve MQP problems, a new linearization technique based on Karush-Kuhn Tucker optimality conditions, proven to guarantee the global optimality, is developed. A novel combination of methods for determining the optimal parameters and temporal patterns are applied to real-world electroencephalogram (EEG) time series for prediction of epileptic seizures. The results show that the combination of these techniques provides accurate results while improving dramatically the time required to quantify chaos in time series, and eliminating a range of parameters that have, thus far, been fixed empirically. Sensitivity analysis is employed to justify the use of this combination of methods, and comparisons are made with more conventional quantifying techniques and trivial measures showing the advantage of the results generated by this work.},

abstract = {The assumption that volcanic tremor may be generated by deterministic nonlinear source processes is now supported by a number of studies at different volcanoes worldwide that clearly demonstrate the low-dimensional nature of the phenomenon. We applied methods based on the theory of nonlinear dynamics to volcanic tremor events recorded at Sangay volcano, Ecuador in order to obtain more information regarding the physics of their source mechanism. The data were acquired during 21–26 April 1998 and were recorded using a sampling interval of 125 samples s 1 by two broadband seismometers installed near the active vent of the volcano. In a previous study JOHNSON and LEES (2000) classified the signals into three groups: (1) short duration ({\textless}1 min) impulses generated by degassing explosions at the vent; (2) extended degassing ‘chugging' events with a duration 2–5 min containing well-defined integer overtones (1–5 Hz) and variable higher frequency content; (3) extended degassing events that contain significant energy above 5 Hz. We selected 12 events from groups 2 and 3 for our analysis that had a duration of at least 90 s and high signal-to-noise ratios. The phase space, which describes the evolution of the behavior of a nonlinear system, was reconstructed using the delay embedding theorem suggested by Takens. The delay time used for the reconstruction was chosen after examining the first zero crossing of the autocorrelation function and the first minimum of the Average Mutual Information (AMI) of the data. In most cases it was found that both methods yielded a delay time of 14–18 samples (0.112–0.144 s) for group 2 and 5 samples (0.04 s) for group 3 events. The sufficient embedding dimension was estimated using the false nearest neighbors method which had a value of 4 for events in group 2 and was in the range 5–7 for events in group 3. Based on these embedding parameters it was possible to calculate the correlation dimension of the resulting attractor, as well as the average divergence rate of nearby orbits given by the largest Lyapunov exponent. Events in group 2 exhibited lower values of both the correlation dimension (1.8–2.6) and largest Lyapunov exponent (0.013–0.022) in comparison with the events in group 3 where the values of these quantities were in the range 2.4–3.5 and 0.029–0.043, respectively. Theoretically, a nonlinear oscillation described by the equation €xx þ b{\_}xx þ cgðxÞ ¼ f cosxt can generate deterministic signals with characteristics similar to those observed in groups 2 and 3 as the values of the parameters b; c; f ;x are drifting, causing instability of orbits in the phase space.},

abstract = {Research on how multinational firms deal with home-host cultural differences argues that cultural differences are minimized and assumes that foreign cultures are homogenous. In this paper we relax the cultural homogeneity assumption. In the presence of cultural variation in host countries the minimization of cultural differences leads existing mean-based indices of cultural differences to overestimate the actual cultural differences these firms have to deal with. We test this argument in a 25-year panel analysis of total US multinationals' foreign sales in 54 host countries. At the sample average of cultural variation, the use of mean cultural difference indices yields a 74{\%} overestimate of the actual cultural difference effect. This suggests that home-host cultural differences are a substantially smaller barrier to multinational sales than hitherto assumed. The assumption of cultural homogeneity leads to conclusions in which a too large role is attributed to cultural differences. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The technical tools utilized in this book fall into three distinct, but interconnected areas: quantitative measures of nonlinear dynamics, Monte–Carlo statistical hypothesis testing, and nonlinear modeling. Ten highly detailed applications serve as case studies of fruitful applications and illustrate the mathematical techniques described in the text."},

abstract = {This study presents an assessment of walking stability in elderly people, focusing on local dynamic stability of walking. Its main objectives were to propose a technique to quantify local dynamic stability using nonlinear time-series analyses and a portable instrument, and to investigate their reliability in revealing the efficacy of an exercise training intervention for elderly people for improvement of walking stability. The method measured three-dimensional acceleration of the upper body, and computation of Lyapunov exponents, thereby directly quantifying the local stability of the dynamic system. Straight level walking of young and elderly subjects was investigated in the experimental study. We compared Lyapunov exponents of young and the elderly subjects, and of groups before and after the exercise intervention. Experimental results demonstrated that the exercise intervention improved local dynamic stability of walking. The proposed method was useful in revealing effects and efficacies of the exercise intervention for elderly people},

Results obtained in a previous work [M. Romero-Bastida, Phys. Rev.

The (r,t) entropy, which measures the amount of information generated by unit time at different scales t of time and r of the observable, is numerically computed by methods of nonlinear time-series analysis using the position and momentum signals of the heavy impurity for various values of the energy density e (energy per degree of freedom) of the system and some values of the impurity mass M. Results obtained from these two time series are compared and discussed.},

We present a step-by-step study of a simple example and provide user-friendly programs that allow an easy reproduction of presented results. In particular, we study an artificial time series generated by the Lorenz system. The mutual information and false nearest neighbour method are explained in detail, and used to obtain the best possible attractor reconstruction. Subsequently, the times series is tested for stationarity and determinism, which are both important properties that assure correct inter-pretation of invariant quantities that can be extracted from the data set. Finally, as the most prominent invariant quantity that allows distinguishing between regular and chaotic behaviour, we calculate the maximal Lyapunov exponent. By following the above steps, we are able to convincingly determine that the Lorenz system is chaotic directly from the generated time series, without the need to use the dif-ferential equations. Throughout the paper, emphasis on clear-cut guidance and a hands-on approach is given in order to make the reproduction of presented results possible also for undergraduates, and thus encourage them to get familiar with the presented theory.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses formal quantitative algorithms that can be used to identify business cycle turning points. An intuitive, graphical derivation of these algorithms is presented along with a description of how they can be implemented making very minimal distributional assumptions. We also provide the intuition and detailed description of these algorithms for both simple parametric univariate inference as well as latent-variable multiple-indicator inference using a state-space Markov-switching approach. We illustrate the promise of this approach by reconstructing the inferences that would have been generated if parameters had to be estimated and inferences drawn based on data as they were originally released at each historical date. Our recommendation is that one should wait until one extra quarter of GDP growth is reported or one extra month of the monthly indicators released before making a call of a business cycle turning point. We introduce two new measures for dating business cycle turning points, which we call the “quarterly real-time GDP-based recession probability index” and the “monthly real-time multiple-indicator recession probability index” that incorporate these principles. Both indexes perform quite well in simulation with real-time data bases. We also discuss some of the potential complicating factors one might want to consider for such an analysis, such as the reduced volatility of output growth rates since 1984 and the changing cyclical behavior of employment. Although such refinements can improve the inference, we nevertheless recommend the simpler specifications which perform very well historically and may be more robust for recognizing future business cycle turning points of unknown character.},

abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics provides a complementary framework to control theory for the quantitative analysis of the oculomotor control system. This paper presents a number of findings relating to the aetiology and mechanics of the pathological ocular oscillation jerk congenital nystagmus (jerk CN). A range of time series analysis techniques were applied to recorded jerk CN waveforms, and also to simulated jerk waveforms produced by an established model in which the oscillations are a consequence of an unstable neural integrator. The results of the analysis were then interpreted within the framework of a generalised model of the unforced oculomotor system.This work suggests that for jerk oscillations, the origin of the instability lies in one of the five oculomotor subsystems, rather than in the final common pathway (the neural integrator and muscle plant). Additionally, experimental estimates of the linearised foveation dynamics imply that a refixating fast phase induced by a near-homoclinic trajectory will result in periodic oscillations. Local dimension calculations show that the dimension of the experimental jerk CN data increases during the fast phase, indicating that the oscillations are not periodic, and hence that the refixation mechanism is of greater complexity than a homoclinic reinjection. The dimension increase is hypothesised to result either from a signal-dependent noise process in the saccadic system, or the activation of additional oculomotor components at the beginning of the fast phase. The modification of a recent saccadic system model to incorporate biologically realistic signal-dependent noise is suggested, in order to test the first of these hypotheses.},

abstract = {A new general dynamical systems approach to data analysis is presented that allows one to track slowly evolving variables responsible for non-stationarity in a fast subsystem. The method is based on the idea of phase space warping, which refers to the small distortions in the fast subsystem's phase space that results from the slow drift, and uses short-time reference model prediction error as its primary measurement of this phenomenon. The basic theory is presented and the issues associated with its implementation in a practical algorithm are discussed. A vector-tracking version of the procedure, based on smooth orthogonal decomposition analysis, is applied to the study of a nonlinear vibrating beam experiment in which a crack propagates to complete fracture. Our method shows that the damage evolution is governed by a scalar process, and we are able to give real-time estimates of the current damage state and identify the governing damage evolution model. Using a final recursive estimation step based on this model, the time to failure is continuously and accurately predicted well in advance of actual failure.},

A new method of obtaining the energy distribution with time and frequency of transformer's core vibration based on Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) was developed. Firstly, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) separated the vibration series into a finite and small number of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). IMF was directly decomposed from vibration series and could reflect the intrinsic physical property of vibration series more clearly. Secondly, Hilbert transform was applied to every IMF. Then, three dimensional amplitude(energy)-frequency-time spectrum designated as Hilbert spectrum was got, where both amplitude and frequency were functions of time. The Hilbert spectrum eliminated the spurious harmonics without physical mean and provided high-resolution time-frequency characteristics of core's different work states, the test results show core vibration characteristics. It is demonstrated that the new detection method is one effective way for fault diagnosis of transformer's core},

abstract = {Evidence suggests that dab and rainbow trout are able to quickly adjust their food intake to an appropriate level when offered novel diets. In addition day-to-day and meal-to-meal food intake varies greatly and meal timing is plastic. Why this is the case is not clear: Food intake in fish is influenced by many factors, however the hierarchy and mechanisms by which these interact is not yet fully understood. A model of food intake may be helpful to understand these phenomena; to determine model type it is necessary to understand the qualitative nature of food intake. Food intake can be regarded as an autoregressive (AR) time series, as the amount of food eaten at time t will be influenced by previous meals, and this allows food intake to be considered using time series analyses. Here, time series data were analysed using nonlinear techniques to obtain qualitative information from which evidence for the hierarchy of mechanisms controlling food intake may be drawn. Time series were obtained for a group of dab and individuals and a group of rainbow trout for analysis. Surrogate data sets were generated to test several null hypotheses describing linear processes and all proved significantly different to the real data, suggesting nonlinear dynamics. Examination of topography and recurrence diagrams suggested that all series were deterministic and non-stationary. The point correlation dimension (PD2i) suggested low-dimensional dynamics. Our findings suggest therefore that any model of appetite should create output that is deterministic, non-stationary, low-dimensional and having nonlinear dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Hyperspectral remotely sensed imagery is often modeled and processed by algorithms assuming that the imagery is a realization of a Gaussian linear stochastic process. These algorithms include some methods for feature extraction, spectral mixture analysis, and spatial analysis. The linear assumption, however, may not be realistic since there are factors that may introduce nonlinearities during the formulation of hyperspectral imagery. The existence of nonlinearity has a negative impact on the effectiveness and accuracy of information extraction. In this study, we propose a method to investigate the existence of nonlinearity in hyperspectral data, represented by a 4m AVIRIS image acquired over an area of coastal forests on Vancouver Island. The proposed method is based on a statistical test using surrogate data, an approach originally introduced in nonlinear time series analysis. High-order autocorrelations are used as the discriminating statistic to evaluate the differences between the hyperspectral data and their surrogates. Instead of conducting a statistical test in time domain as is used in typical time series analysis, we did it in spatial and spectral domains. The investigation revealed that the existence of nonlinearity in hyperspectral data is evident in spectral domain, but not in the spatial domain.},

Characterizing the nature of such behaviors, however, helps the network designers to modify the RED design method in order to achieve better overall performance. In this paper, we first investigate the effect of variations in different RED parameters on the network behavior and then seek for the origin of such complex behaviors. For this purpose, different linear and nonlinear time series analysis methods have been applied to long-duration ns-2 packet-level data traces of a homogeneous TCP/RED network. The results of the analysis confirm that the complex behavior of the network can be represented by a nonlinear stochastic second-order process and it is not due to a deterministic chaos or a non-stationarity in the network. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The multiple sequence alignment problem is one of the im-portant problems in Genome Informatics. The notable fea-ture of this problem is that its state-space forms a lattice. Researchers have applied search algorithms such as A* and memory-bounded search algorithms including SNC to this problem. Unfortunately, previous work could align only seven sequences at most. Korf proposed DCBDS, which ex-ploits the features of a grid, and suggested that DCBDS prob-ably solved this problem, effectively. We found, however, that DCBDS was not effective for aligning many sequences. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective search algo-rithm, A* with Partial Expansion, for state-spaces with large branching factors. The aim of this algorithm is to store only necessary nodes for finding an optimal solution. In node ex-pansion, A* stores all child nodes, while our algorithm stores only promising child nodes. This mechanism enables us to re-duce the memory requirements during a search. We apply our algorithm to the multiple sequence alignment problem. It can align seven sequences with only 4.7{\%} of the stored nodes re-quired by A*.},

abstract = {Evidence suggests that dab and rainbow trout are able to quickly adjust their food intake to an appropriate level when offered novel diets. In addition day-to-day and meal-to-meal food intake varies greatly and meal timing is plastic. Why this is the case is not clear: Food intake in fish is influenced by many factors, however the hierarchy and mechanisms by which these interact is not yet fully understood. A model of food intake may be helpful to understand these phenomena; to determine model type it is necessary to understand the qualitative nature of food intake. Food intake can be regarded as an autoregressive (AR) time series, as the amount of food eaten at time t will be influenced by previous meals, and this allows food intake to be considered using time series analyses. Here, time series data were analysed using nonlinear techniques to obtain qualitative information from which evidence for the hierarchy of mechanisms controlling food intake may be drawn. Time series were obtained for a group of dab and individuals and a group of rainbow trout for analysis. Surrogate data sets were generated to test several null hypotheses describing linear processes and all proved significantly different to the real data, suggesting nonlinear dynamics. Examination of topography and recurrence diagrams suggested that all series were deterministic and non-stationary. The point correlation dimension (PD2i) suggested low-dimensional dynamics. Our findings suggest therefore that any model of appetite should create output that is deterministic, non-stationary, low-dimensional and having nonlinear dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The ozone pollution at ground level in rural and urban areas has been a long-standing problem in the world. This paper focuses on estimating self-affined nature of nonlinearity of ground-level peak ozone time series, which is analyzed by two nonlinear fractal statistical methods, including R/S analysis and BDS test. To explore the underlying structure of ozone observations at ground level and improve the forecasting capacity in urban region, practical implementation was assessed by a case study via collecting and analyzing the monitoring data at Chaojhou and Zenwu in the Kaohsiung metropolitan region, Taiwan. Based on R/S analysis, the time series can be identified as persistent and long-memory processes with Hurst exponents of both about 0.75. In addition, the V statistics specifies possible fluctuation cycle lengths of 32, 170, and 420 day simultaneously. Such results are consistent with the regional meteorological conditions leading to help characterize the regional scale ozone behavioral trend. Furthermore, the BDS test results confirm a strong nonlinearity of both time series associated with these two cities. Yet in both cases, nonlinearity implies chaos. The R/S analysis and BDS test provide strong evidence for nonlinearity and fractality of ozone time series due to noisy chaos, and we could not rule out the possibility of deterministic chaos in tropospheric ozone system. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that the predictability of silicon content in hot metal of the selected BFs approaches that of a totally predictable system while it departs from that of a totally unpredictable system greatly. The predictability of silicon sequences conversely renders a strong indication of the presence of a deterministic mechanism ruling the dynamics of the ironmaking blast furnace process. In the meantime, the results also provide important information on selecting the minimum number of macroscopic variables and the delay time needed for reconstructing the dynamics of these blast furnace systems. Moreover, the above information is found to be independent of the size of these blast furnaces. However, there is a slight difference in the complexity of the silicon sequence collected from different types of blast furnaces. As one might expect, larger difficulty will be encountered in predicting the silicon content of a pint-sized blast furnace because of the presence of the larger complexity.},

abstract = {Legume plants form beneficial symbiotic interactions with nitrogen fixing bacteria (called rhizobia), with the rhizobia being accommodated in unique structures on the roots of the host plant. The legume/rhizobial symbiosis is responsible for a significant proportion of the global biologically available nitrogen. The initiation of this symbiosis is governed by a characteristic calcium oscillation within the plant root hair cells and this signal is activated by the rhizobia. Recent analyses on calcium time series data have suggested that stochastic effects have a large role to play in defining the nature of the oscillations. The use of multiple nonlinear time series techniques, however, suggests an alternative interpretation, namely deterministic chaos. We provide an extensive, nonlinear time series analysis on the nature of this calcium oscillation response. We build up evidence through a series of techniques that test for determinism, quantify linear and nonlinear components, and measure the local divergence of the system. Chaos is common in nature and it seems plausible that properties of chaotic dynamics might be exploited by biological systems to control processes within the cell. Systems possessing chaotic control mechanisms are more robust in the sense that the enhanced flexibility allows more rapid response to environmental changes with less energetic costs. The desired behaviour could be most efficiently targeted in this manner, supporting some intriguing speculations about nonlinear mechanisms in biological signaling.},

abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis was used to estimate maximal Lyapunov exponents of select ankle and knee kinematics during three different conditions of treadmill walking: independent, side by side, and side by side with forced synchronization of stepping. Stride to stride variability was significantly increased for the condition in which individuals walked side by side and synchronized unintentionally when compared to the conditions of forced synchronization and independent walking. In addition, standard deviations of three kinematic variables of lower extremity movement were significantly increased during the condition in which unintentional synchronization occurred. No relationship was found between standard deviation and estimates of maximal Lyapunov exponents. An increase in kinematic variability during side by side walking for nonimpaired individuals who are not at risk of falling suggests that variability in certain aspects of performance might be indicative of a healthy system. Modeling this variability for an impaired individual to imitate may have beneficial effects on locomotor function. These results may therefore have implications for the rehabilitation of gait in humans by suggesting that a different functional outcome might be achieved by practicing side by side walking as opposed to more commonly used strategies involving independent walking.},

abstract = {Ants have evolved very complex societies and are key ecosystem members. Some ants, such as the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, are also major pests. Here, we present a draft genome of S. invicta, assembled from Roche 454 and Illumina sequencing reads obtained from a focal haploid male and his brothers. We used comparative genomic methods to obtain insight into the unique features of the S. invicta genome. For example, we found that this genome harbors four adjacent copies of vitellogenin. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that an ancestral vitellogenin gene first underwent a duplication that was followed by possibly independent duplications of each of the daughter vitellogenins. The vitellogenin genes have undergone subfunctionalization with queen- and worker-specific expression, possibly reflecting differential selection acting on the queen and worker castes. Additionally, we identified more than 400 putative olfactory receptors of which at least 297 are intact. This represents the largest repertoire reported so far in insects. S. invicta also harbors an expansion of a specific family of lipid-processing genes, two putative orthologs to the transformer/feminizer sex differentiation gene, a functional DNA methylation system, and a single putative telomerase ortholog. EST data indicate that this S. invicta telomerase ortholog has at least four spliceforms that differ in their use of two sets of mutually exclusive exons. Some of these and other unique aspects of the fire ant genome are likely linked to the complex social behavior of this species.},

Starting from the concept of recurrences in phase space, the recurrence matrix of a time series is interpreted as the adjacency matrix of an associated complex network, which links different points in time if the considered states are closely neighboured in phase space. In comparison with similar network-based techniques the new approach has important conceptual advantages, and can be considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex networks that also includes other existing methods as special cases. It has been demonstrated here that there are fundamental relationships between many topological properties of recurrence networks and different nontrivial statistical properties of the phase space density of the underlying dynamical system. Hence, this novel interpretation of the recurrence matrix yields new quantitative characteristics (such as average path length, clustering coefficient, or centrality measures of the recurrence network) related to the dynamical complexity of a time series, most of which are not yet provided by other existing methods of nonlinear time series analysis.},

abstract = {In electricity markets where supply and demand drives the price for the purchase and sale of electricity, generating firms change capacity for various reasons including load level, policy, and varying market conditions. These types of fluctuating production patterns can result in the reduction of market efficiency. In an inefficient market, where the price for electricity exceeds marginal cost, the locational marginal price (LMP) is often used to measure market efficiency. Stochastically driven changes in the market are captured by this approach, however, these random changes (frequently observed in efficient markets as well) do not affect market efficiency in the long run. Conversely, a slow, consistent change is not captured by the snap-shot approach and affects the efficiency significantly. Therefore, it is necessary to construct an algorithm that captures only consistent changes that truly affect market efficiency. Fractal analysis can characterize a price behavior in the electricity markets because the price exhibits a self-similarity.11A self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself. Once a system undergoes a change, the fractal dimension of the system reflects the change.

A sophisticated nonlinear time$\backslash$nseries analysis in combination with a surrogate data method, which has$\backslash$nnot been widely applied to the study of combustion phenomena, clearly$\backslash$ndemonstrates that the dynamic behavior undergoes a significant$\backslash$ntransition from periodic oscillation to low-dimensional deterministic$\backslash$nchaos with increasing rotational Reynolds number.},

abstract = {Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a widely used tool for nanoscale surface analysis. Dynamic atomic force microscopy (tapping or non-contact mode) consists of a vibrating microcantilever with a nanoscale tip that interacts with a sample surface via short- and long-range intermolecular forces Due to the need of high precision measurements, the interaction forces between the nanotip and the specimen must be carefully examined and analyzed in order to best evaluate the nonlinear dynamical response of the AFM system. Recent research on AFM systems has focused on detailed numerical analysis such that possible chaotic regions can be well defined. In this paper, nonlinear time-series analysis methods (NTSA) are applied to analyze signals generated by a numerical single-degree-of-freedom lumped-model of a dynamic-mode AFM. The signal characteristics will provide useful insight of the nonlinear system response leading in future work, to the evaluation of deterministic uncertainty in real-time AFM measurements that is being introduced because of these complex phenomena. The confirmation of chaos existence and the prediction of the regions where chaotic motion is possible remain crucial for the quality of AFM images. The methods used for the system analysis include Autocorrelation Function, Power Spectral Density Analysis, Phase-space analysis, Poincare Maps and Lyapunov Indicator All the above computational techniques can then be applied to experimental AFM data in order to find system parameters and regimes, which ensure stable motions across the sample surface scanning process.},

abstract = {GRS 1915+105 is a prominent black hole system exhibiting variability over a wide range of time scales and its observed light curves have been classified into 12 temporal states. Here we undertake a complete analysis of these light curves from all the states using various quantifiers from nonlinear time series analysis, such as, the correlation dimension (D{\_}2), the correlation entropy (K{\_}2), singular value decomposition (SVD) and the multifractal spectrum ({\$}f(\backslashalpha){\$} spectrum). An important aspect of our analysis is that, for estimating these quantifiers, we use algorithmic schemes which we have proposed recently and tested successfully on synthetic as well as practical time series from various fields. Though the schemes are based on the conventional delay embedding technique, they are automated so that the above quantitative measures can be computed using conditions prescribed by the algorithm and without any intermediate subjective analysis. We show that nearly half of the 12 temporal states exhibit deviation from randomness and their complex temporal behavior could be approximated by a few (3 or 4) coupled ordinary nonlinear differential equations. These results could be important for a better understanding of the processes that generate the light curves and hence for modelling the temporal behavior of such complex systems. To our knowledge, this is the first complete analysis of an astrophysical object (let alone a black hole system) using various techniques from nonlinear dynamics.},

Based on the nonlinear time series analysis method, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of arm swing in three conditions (natural, active and restricted arm swing) on the dynamic stability of spine and lower extremity joints, and to further assess the contribution of arm swing to the human dynamic stability in relation with age. Gait experiments were carried out for 10 young and 8 middle-aged healthy volunteers while walking with natural, active and restricted arm swing. The maximum finite time lyapunov exponents were calculated to quantify the local dynamic stability of spine and lower extremity joints under three arm swing conditions, and the percentage change of the maximum Lyapunov exponents was compared between two groups to evaluate the effectiveness of active arm swing in relation with age. For both young and middle-aged groups, no significant difference of the maximum lyapunov exponents of all motion segments was found between walking with natural arm swing and with restricted arm swing (P{\textgreater}0.05). However, the maximum lyapunov exponents of all motion segments while walking with active arm swing was significantly lower than those while walking with natural arm swing and restricted arm swing, respectively (P{\textless}0.05), and the percentage decrease of the maximum lyapunov exponents for all motion segments while walking with active arm swing was significantly higher in middle-aged group than in young group (P{\textless}0.05). These results indicated that active arm swing would help to improve dynamic stability of human motion segments, especially more effective with age.},

We employed data from different sets of experiments with various initial conditions out of circular and elliptical shaped nozzles in order to identify time series taken at the jet axis, and discriminate them from those taken near the boundary with ambient fluid using nonconventional hydrodynamics methods. For each temperature time series measured at a different distance from jet axis, we estimated mainly nonlinear measures such as mutual information combined with descriptive statistics measures, as well as some linear and nonlinear dynamic detectors such as Hurst exponent, detrended fluctuation analysis, and Hjorth parameters. The results obtained in all cases have shown that the proposed methodology allows us to distinguish the flow regime around the jet axis and identify the time series corresponding to the jet axis in agreement with the conventional statistical hydrodynamic method. Furthermore, in order to reject the null hypothesis that the time series originate from a stochastic process, we applied the surrogate data method.},

Calculation of the correlation dimension and the largest Lyapunov exponent from the PD sequence is used to illustrate the nonlinear characteristics of the PD behavior in the electrical tree growth. The results provide strong evidence for the existence of deterministic chaos in the PD phenomenon of electrical trees, where the correlation dimension and the largest Lyapunov exponent are related with the PD activity of the tree growth, rather than a presence of random stochastic process. The fluctuating correlation dimension of the PD sequence during the branch-pine tree growth is associated with the transition of PD patterns and the change of the channel conductivity of the tree structure. It is also found that the nonlinear dynamics characteristics of the PD sequence are influenced by the applied voltage, the channel conductivity and the electrical tree shape.

As remarked in a review by Howell Tong in 2001, for about 100 years up to 2001 Biometrika (alone) published over 400 papers on the subject. [Tong (2001)] Furthermore, in the review, Howell Tong is able break down up to fifteen key areas of research interest in time series analysis. Nonetheless, unlike that of Howell Tong, the aim of the review in this paper is not to cover a wide range of topics on the subject, but is to concentrate on a small, but extremely essential, point he made on the semiparametric methods in nonlinear time series analysis and to explore into various aspects of this research area in much more details. It is also an objective of this review to provide some discussion on a future research where appropriate.},

abstract = {Background: Over the past decade, there have been resurgences and large-scale outbreaks of mumps worldwide. Little evidence is available on the relationship between meteorological factors and the incidence of mumps. We aimed to explore the effects of meteorological factors on mumps incidence. Methods: A Poisson regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used to evaluate the association between meteorological factors and the mumps incidence in Guangzhou, China, 2005-2012. Results: Nonlinear relationships between meteorological factors, except sunshine hours, and mumps incidence were observed. The relative risks (RRs) of mean temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure were 1.81 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.41 to 2.32), 1.28 (95{\%} CI, 1.02 to 1.59), and 0.80 (95{\%} CI, 0.67 to 0.95) comparing the 99th percentile to the median of their own, respectively. For wind velocity, the RR was 0.70 (95{\%}CI, 0.54 to 0.91) comparing the 1st percentile to the median. The hot effect and cold effect were larger in females than in males, and the hot effect increased with age. Conclusions: Mean temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity and atmospheric pressure might be important predictors of the mumps incidence. Tropical cyclone caused a higher increase in mumps cases. Our findings highlight the need to strengthen the awareness of using protective measures during typhoon days and allocating more attention to the susceptible populations during the summer. The two-dose regimen of mumps vaccine should be included in the National Immunization Program schedule, and the catch-up vaccination campaigns should be promoted among adults. {\textcopyright} 2014 Landes Bioscience.},

@article{Bradley2015a,
abstract = {In 1980 and 1981, two pioneering papers laid the foundation for what became known as nonlinear time-series analysis: the analysis of observed data---typically univariate---via dynamical systems theory. Based on the concept of state-space reconstruction, this set of methods allows us to compute characteristic quantities such as Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions, to predict the future course of the time series, and even to reconstruct the equations of motion in some cases. In practice, however, there are a number of issues that restrict the power of this approach: whether the signal accurately and thoroughly samples the dynamics, for instance, and whether it contains noise. Moreover, the numerical algorithms that we use to instantiate these ideas are not perfect; they involve approximations, scale parameters, and finite-precision arithmetic, among other things. Even so, nonlinear time-series analysis has been used to great advantage on thousands of real and synthetic data sets from a wide variety of systems ranging from roulette wheels to lasers to the human heart. Even in cases where the data do not meet the mathematical or algorithmic requirements to assure full topological conjugacy, the results of nonlinear time-series analysis can be helpful in understanding, characterizing, and predicting dynamical systems.},

The aim of the study was to obtain more information about the cycle-to-cycle variation (CCV) in the studied simplified ICE geometry than what is available from standard methods. Phase space reconstructions were created from the time series and then estimates for the largest Lyapunov exponent were calculated. The time delays used in the phase space reconstructions were determined using average mutual information while the proper embedding dimensions were chosen according to the method of false nearest neighbours. Quantitative information on the behaviour of the flow and the CCV was acquired from three-dimensional phase space reconstructions. Introduced modifications to the flow were clearly visible in the phase space reconstructions of energy and dissipation, indicating that these quantities are appropriate for monitoring and analysing the state of the system. The estimates for the largest Lyapunov exponents were positive for almost all time series, indicating chaotic dynamics. The permutation spectrum test was used to confirm the chaoticity of the CCV. The present results indicate that the used methods offer a promising new framework for characterising the CCV from the viewpoint of nonlinear time series analysis.},

abstract = {{\"{i}}¿½ 2016 Author(s). In the standard two-electrode configuration employed in electrolytic process, when the control dc voltage is brought to a critical value, the system undergoes a transition from conventional electrolysis to contact glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE), which has also been referred to as liquid-submerged micro-plasma, glow discharge plasma electrolysis, electrode effect, electrolytic plasma, etc. The light-emitting process is associated with the development of an irregular and erratic current time-series which has been arbitrarily labelled as "random," and thus dissuaded further research in this direction. Here, we examine the current time-series signals measured in cathodic CGDE configuration in a concentrated KOH solution at different dc bias voltages greater than the critical voltage. We show that the signals are, in fact, not random according to the NIST SP. 800-22 test suite definition. We also demonstrate that post-processing low-pass filtered sequences requires less time than the native as-measured sequences, suggesting a superposition of low frequency chaotic fluctuations and high frequency behaviors (which may be produced by more than one possible source of entropy). Using an array of nonlinear time-series analyses for dynamical systems, i.e., the computation of largest Lyapunov exponents and correlation dimensions, and re-construction of phase portraits, we found that low-pass filtered datasets undergo a transition from quasi-periodic to chaotic to quasi-hyper-chaotic behavior, and back again to chaos when the voltage controlling-parameter is increased. The high frequency part of the signals is discussed in terms of highly nonlinear turbulent motion developed around the working electrode.},

In this work we propose an extension to Growing Neural Gas (GNG) for dealing with the spatiotemporal quantization of time series. The two main changes to the original GNG algorithm are the following. First, the basic unit of the GNG network is changed from a node to a linear segment joining two nodes. Secondly, temporal connections between neighboring units in time are added. The proposed algorithm called Segment GNG (SGNG) is compared with the original GNG and Merge GNG algorithms using three benchmark time series: R{\"{o}}ssler, Mackey-Glass and NH3 Laser. The algorithms are applied to the quantization of trajectories in the state space representation of these time series. The results show that the SGNG outperforms both GNG and Merge GNG in terms of quantization error and temporal quantization error.},

abstract = {The speech-evoked auditory brainstem response (sABR) shows how complex sounds such as speech and music are processed in the auditory system. Speech-ABR could be used to evaluate particular impairments and improvements in auditory processing system. Many researchers used linear approaches for characterizing different components of sABR signal, whereas nonlinear techniques are not applied so commonly. The primary aim of the present study is to examine the underlying dynamics of normal sABR signals. The secondary goal is to evaluate whether some chaotic features exist in this signal. We have presented a methodology for determining various components of sABR signals, by performing Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) to get the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, composite multiscale entropy (CMSE), the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and deterministic nonlinear prediction are computed for each extracted IMF. EEMD decomposes sABR signal into five modes and a residue. The CMSE results of sABR signals obtained from 40 healthy people showed that 1st, and 2nd IMFs were similar to the white noise, IMF-3 with synthetic chaotic time series and 4th, and 5th IMFs with sine waveform. LLE analysis showed positive values for 3rd IMFs. Moreover, 1st, and 2nd IMFs showed overlaps with surrogate data and 3rd, 4th and 5th IMFs showed no overlap with corresponding surrogate data. Results showed the presence of noisy, chaotic and deterministic components in the signal which respectively corresponded to 1st, and 2nd IMFs, IMF-3, and 4th and 5th IMFs. While these findings provide supportive evidence of the chaos conjecture for the 3rd IMF, they do not confirm any such claims. However, they provide a first step towards an understanding of nonlinear behavior of auditory system dynamics in brainstem level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Here, we give theoretical support for justifying the use of InDDeCs and provide numerical examples to show that InDDeCs can be used for various applications for obtaining the recurrence plots, correlation dimensions, and maximal Lyapunov exponents, as well as testing directional couplings and extracting slow-driving forces. We demonstrate performance of the InDDeCs using the weather data. Thus, InDDeCs can eventually realize "dimensionless embedding" while we enjoy faster and more reliable computations.},

abstract = {Rotavirus is a common viral infection among young children. As in many countries, the infection dynamics of rotavirus in the Netherlands are characterized by an annual winter peak, which was notably low in 2014. Previous study suggested an association between weather factors and both rotavirus transmission and incidence. From epidemic theory, we know that the proportion of susceptible individuals can affect disease transmission. We investigated how these factors are associated with rotavirus transmission in the Netherlands, and their impact on rotavirus transmission in 2014. We used available data on birth rates and rotavirus laboratory reports to estimate rotavirus transmission and the proportion of individuals susceptible to primary infection. Weather data were directly available from a central meteorological station. We developed an approach for detecting determinants of seasonal rotavirus transmission by assessing nonlinear, delayed associations between each factor and rotavirus transmission. We explored relationships by applying a distributed lag nonlinear regression model with seasonal terms. We corrected for residual serial correlation using autoregressive moving average errors. We inferred the relationship between different factors and the effective reproduction number from the most parsimonious model with low residual autocorrelation. Higher proportions of susceptible individuals and lower temperatures were associated with increases in rotavirus transmission. For 2014, our findings suggest that relatively mild temperatures combined with the low proportion of susceptible individuals contributed to lower rotavirus transmission in the Netherlands. However, our model, which overestimated the magnitude of the peak, suggested that other factors were likely instrumental in reducing the incidence that year.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Using a homemade optical measuring system, time series related to two‐phase flow dynamics under different operating conditions, fluids, and channel lengths were collected and analyzed via a nonlinear characteristic parameter, Kolmogorov entropy (KE). Our results reveal that higher KE corresponds to unstable flow behavior, while lower KE refers to steady flow behavior; higher KE values appear at comparatively low or high gas flow rates, and most Taylor flow regime appeared at proper operating conditions with small KE. An equation derived based on the definition of KE is proposed to better understand KE characteristics, which include bubble break‐up impact and gas/liquid flow rate ratio. Predictions from the proposed analytical equation agree with experimental results, suggesting that the equation effectively identifies unstable flows and can be used to ensure stable and predictable multiphase flows in microchannels. {\textcopyright} 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 2378–2385, 2017},

In a previous paper, the authors studied the limits of probabilistic prediction in nonlinear time series analysis in a perfect model scenario, i.e., in the ideal case that the uncertainty of an otherwise deterministic model is due to only the finite precision of the observations. The model consisted of the symbolic dynamics of a measure-preserving transformation with respect to a finite partition of the state space, and the quality of the predictions was measured by the so-called ignorance score, which is a conditional entropy. In practice, though, partitions are dispensed with by considering numerical and experimental data to be continuous, which prompts us to trade off in this paper the Shannon entropy for the differential entropy. Despite technical differences, we show that the core of the previous results also hold in this extended scenario for sufficiently high precision. The corresponding imperfect model scenario will be revisited too because it is relevant for the applications. The theoretical part and its application to probabilistic forecasting are illustrated with numerical simulations and a new prediction algorithm.},

abstract = {Legume plants form beneficial symbiotic interactions with nitrogen fixing bacteria (called rhizobia), with the rhizobia being accommodated in unique structures on the roots of the host plant. The legume/rhizobial symbiosis is responsible for a significant proportion of the global biologically available nitrogen. The initiation of this symbiosis is governed by a characteristic calcium oscillation within the plant root hair cells and this signal is activated by the rhizobia. Recent analyses on calcium time series data have suggested that stochastic effects have a large role to play in defining the nature of the oscillations. The use of multiple nonlinear time series techniques, however, suggests an alternative interpretation, namely deterministic chaos. We provide an extensive, nonlinear time series analysis on the nature of this calcium oscillation response. We build up evidence through a series of techniques that test for determinism, quantify linear and nonlinear components, and measure the local divergence of the system. Chaos is common in nature and it seems plausible that properties of chaotic dynamics might be exploited by biological systems to control processes within the cell. Systems possessing chaotic control mechanisms are more robust in the sense that the enhanced flexibility allows more rapid response to environmental changes with less energetic costs. The desired behaviour could be most efficiently targeted in this manner, supporting some intriguing speculations about nonlinear mechanisms in biological signaling.},

abstract = {In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature addressing the utilization of complex network methods for the characterization of dynamical systems based on time series. While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems. The overall aim of this report is to provide the readers with the knowledge how the complex network approaches can be applied to their own field of real-world time series analysis.},

This resulting figure is then reinterpreted as a com- plex network, which is further characterized by network statistical measures. We illustrate the computational power of RDE-CN approach by time series by both the logistic map and experi- mental fluid flows, which show that our method distinguishes different dynamics sufficiently well as the traditional recurrence analysis. Therefore, the proposed methodology characterizes the recurrence matrix adequately, while using a reduced set of points from the original recurrence plots.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Author(s). In this study, we present results of the application of nonlinear time series analysis on traffic data for incident detection. More specifically, we analyze daily volume records of Attica Tollway (Greece) collected from sensors located at various locations. The analysis was performed using the Recurrence Plot (RP) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) method of the volume data of the lane closest to the median. The results show that it is possible to identify, through the abrupt change of the dynamics of the system revealed by RPs and RQA, the occurrence of incidents on the freeway and differentiate from recurrent traffic congestion. The proposed methodology could be of interest for big data traffic analysis.},

abstract = {The sampled pressure signals in continuously rotating detonation combustors have the inherence of nonlinear dynamics. To dig out more information on combustion modes, the nonlinear time series analysis method is thus applied to the pressure-time series obtained at a hydrogen/air rotating detonation combustor by using the phase space reconstruction and wavelet entropy algorithm. The variation of wavelet entropy is approved to be associated with the periodicity variation of pressure signals. Different structures of attractor as well as wavelet entropy distribution in the phase diagram can distinguish the deflagration mode from the unstable and stable detonation modes under the conditions of different air flow rates. The limit-cycle oscillation is exhibited in the phase space diagram with a very low flow rate, here 25 g/s. The mean wavelet entropy of pressure-time series can be a quantitative index of different combustion modes occurring in the combustor. The present study is expected to enhance the understanding of the physical mechanism of continuously rotating detonation and contribute on the development of detonation propulsion technology.},

abstract = {Recent applications of nonlinear time-series analysis have shown that thermoacoustic systems can exhibit self-excited behavior more complex than simple period-1 oscillations. Such behavior has been comprehensively explored in the Rijke tube and in gas turbines, but less so in rocket engines. In this experimental study, we examine the thermoacoustic oscillations of a full-scale solid rocket motor (SRM) by means of nonlinear time-series analysis, namely phase portraits, Poincar{\'{e}} maps and recurrence plots. In contrast to conventional linear tools based on the Fourier transform, these nonlinear tools can enable unambiguous identification of different dynamical states, such as period-k states, quasiperiodicity and chaos. In this study, these tools reveal limit-cycle dynamics not reported before in an SRM, such as transient mode switching between unstable attractors in phase space, with transitions between period-2 and period-3 states. In summary, this study constitutes the first experimental application of nonlinear time-series analysis to a full-scale SRM, demonstrating an alternative to conventional linear tools for the characterization of nonlinear thermoacoustic oscillations in rocket engines.},

@article{Leonor2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 L  {\&}  H Scientific Publishing, LLC. The analysis of time series in the era of Big Data has become a major challenge for computational framework research. Furthemore, in the areas of space science which deals with a large variety of data, the practical consistence between workload, workflow and cloud computing is crucial. Here, such consistence is provided by an innovative e-Science framework project named Sentinel which is based on a NoSQL data base (MongoDB) and a containerization platform (Docker). This web framework supports researchers for time series analysis in a cloud environment where they can easily access, parameterize, initialize and monitor their applications. As a case study in the Brazilian Space Weather Program, we consider the intensive analysis of time series from a complex information system for solar activity monitoring and forecasting. As a prototype for implementing the framework, the DFA (detrended fluctuation analysis) technique was used as a nonlinear spectrum analyzer applied to the solar irradiance measurements from 1978 to 2012. Moreover, new applications can be added and managed by researchers on the portal easily to complement their data analysis purposes.},

@article{Kanazawa2018,
abstract = {I propose a flexible nonlinear method for studying the time series properties of macroeconomic variables. In particular, I focus on a class of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) called the Radial Basis Functions (RBF). To assess the valid-ity of the RBF approach in the macroeconomic time series analysis, I conduct a Monte Carlo experiment using the data generated from a nonlinear New Key-nesian (NK) model. I find that the RBF estimator can uncover the structure of the nonlinear NK model from the simulated data whose length is as small as 300 periods. Finally, I apply the RBF estimator to the quarterly US data and show that the response of the macroeconomic variables to a positive supply shock exhibits a substantial time variation. In particular, the positive supply shocks are found to have significantly weaker expansionary e↵ects during the zero lower bound periods as well as periods between 2003 and 2004. The find-ing is consistent with a basic NK model, which predicts that the higher real interest rate due to the monetary policy inaction weakens the e↵ects of supply shocks.},
